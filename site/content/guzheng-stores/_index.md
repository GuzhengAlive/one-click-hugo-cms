      Here is a map of commercial stores that sell guzheng in North America.
      Teachers may also sell instruments; check the Teacher Page to find someone
      near you. 




      Don't worry if you need to have an instrument shipped to you. A properly
      packaged guzheng travels just fine in domestic post. I have sent or
      received instruments coast to coast and from states in between and they
      all arrived intact. Make sure your seller provides shipping insurance and
      has a sensible return policy.
