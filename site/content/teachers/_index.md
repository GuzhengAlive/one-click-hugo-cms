      Here is a map of guzheng teachers or teaching organizations who have
      active websites worldwide. There are many more teachers who don't have
      websites; ask around in your community to find teachers close to you.
      Please send in an email if you have updated information or teachers to
      add. Locations on the map are not exact for the sake of teacher privacy.
      Visit their websites for more information. Visit ChineseZither.net’s List
      of Teachers for even more teachers and direct contact information.




      I haven’t added teachers in most Asian countries because…. my goodness
      that would be a long list. There are other resources for finding teachers
      in languages other than English such as GuzhengClub.com; I am unable to
      document them all.

      Red: Teachers at accredited Universities


      Blue: Studios or Individual Teachers


      Rationale for only including teachers with websites: Respects teacher
      privacy, minimizes time required to maintain the list, and decreases the
      chance of showing outdated/incorrect information.
