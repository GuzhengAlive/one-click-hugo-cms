title: Virtual Instruments and Software Libraries
image: /img/white-background.jpeg
intro: >-
  Here’s a quick roundup of virtual guzheng instruments and software for
  composers and producers. You’ll need a version of Kontakt Player to run these.
  They range from $60-$120. Impact Soundworks seems to have the best interface,
  best control set, and a great set of techniques, but I haven’t given it a try.




  Evolution Series ranks second. They have a more focused list of techniques
  with several options for tremolo, a slightly less usable interface, and are
  the most expensive. Soniccoutoure was most recently updated, so that’s nice.




  There are non-Kontakt options out there. Best Service, A company in Germany,
  Released Yellow River Sound Guzheng in 2009.  Price: $129 USD.  


  Sound Magic / Supreme Piano, an unknown, possibly China-based company released
  Guzheng in 2019 for $99.




  There are various Sample Libraries out there if you don’t want a virtual
  instrument. One example is the 2009 “Silk’ from Sounds Online. They include
  guzheng with 22 other sampled instruments in their $299 USD library.
