      The names of the parts are truly magical. Below are the various synonyms
      in Mandarin and English and a 3D model you can explore to see how the
      parts all come together.

      1) Dragon: The top of the instrument or portion by the performer (龙／龍,
      lóng). 


      Also Head (头/頭, tóu), Dragon Head (龙头/龍頭, lóngtóu), Leader (首, shǒu)




      2) Phoenix: The bottom of the instrument or portion farthest from the
      performer (风/鳳, fèng).


      Also Tail (尾, wěi), Phoenix Tail (风尾/鳳尾, fèng wěi). 




      3) Soundboard: The curving piece of wood underneath the strings (面板,
      miànbǎn).


      Also translated to English as Faceboard.




      4) Strings: The silk, metal, or nylon-coated metal threads that stretch
      above the soundboard (弦, xián).


      An older variant was written 絃, with the same meaning and pronunciation.
      You might also hear english speakers refer to metal strings as wires, or
      silk strings as threads.




      5) (High) Mountains: The general term for the ridges of material at the
      tail and head of the instrument that act as end points for the
      strings(岳山/嶽山, yuèshān). (2)


      Also Fixed Bridges in English.




      6) Mountain Pass: The straight fixed bridge by the performer, at the head
      of the instrument (山口, shānkǒu). 


      Also Front bridge (前梁, qián liáng)  Front (high) Mountain (前岳山/ 前嶽山, qián
      yuèshān).




      7) Rear Bridge: The fixed bridge at the far end of the instrument (后梁/後梁,
      Hòu liáng)


      Also S-Bridge in English, and Rear (High) Mountain (后岳山/後嶽山, hòu yuèshān)
      (2).




      8) Bridges: The roughly triangular/pyramidal supports that lift the
      strings off the soundboard. (马/馬, mǎ) (3)


      Also Moveable Bridge in English, Pillar (柱, zhù), Wild Goose Pillar (雁柱,
      yàn zhù). 雁 may not be a direct translation, much like 马 above. (琴码/琴碼,
      qín mǎ), or (码子/碼子, mǎ zi) use the character 码 but I have yet to find a
      translation I understand. The closest I have gotten is "counter", as in,
      something that indicates a number, and there are certainly a lot of
      strings to keep track of.

      9) Tuning Box: The compartment in the head of the instrument where the
      tuning pegs are located (调音盒/調音盒, tiáoyīn hé)


      Also (String) Tuning Box (调弦盒/調弦盒,  tiáo xián hé).




      10) Cover: The cover to the compartment that holds the tuning pegs, and is
      often used as extra storage space for additional tools (琴盖/琹蓋, qín gài).


      Also Box Cover (盒盖/盒蓋, hé gài).  




      11) Tuning pins: The metal pins that one end of the strings are wound
      around; twisting the pins raises and lowers the tension in the strings and
      therefore, their pitch or tuning (弦轴/弦軸, xián zhóu)


      Also Spool (轴/軸, zhóu), String Nail (弦钉/弦釘, xián dīng), (肖子, xiàozǐ) (no
      translation yet) and reportedly (轸/軫, zhěn) (no translation yet).




      12) Side Board: The edge face of the instrument, part of the frame. Often
      have artwork (边板/邊板, biān bǎn).


      Aso Side (舷, xián), more literall y, Side Panel (侧板/側板, cè bǎn)

      13) Backboard: The back panel of the instrument that helps form the
      resonating chamber (底板/底板, dǐbǎn).


      Also Backboard (背板, bèi bǎn).




      14) Sound Holes: The cutouts in the backboard that allow sound to escape
      from the resonating chamber in the body of the instrument (出音孔, chū yīn
      kǒng). (4)


      Also Sound (Emitting) Hole (发音孔／發音孔, fāyīn kǒng).




      15) Dragon Pond: The sound hole under the Dragon end, or head of the
      instrument (龙池/龍池, lóngchí).


      Also Dragon Cave (龙穴/龍穴, lóng xué).




      16) Celestial Pond: The sound hole in the center of the backboard (天池,
      tiānchí).


      Also Earth well (地... di tan), and 懸 眼. Reportedly zheng can be hung from
      the wall by this point.




      17) Phoenix Eyes: The curving sound hole found under the Phoenix end, or
      tail, of the instrument  (风眼/鳳眼, fèng yǎn). Sometimes carved in reflected
      pairs. Also provides access to one end of the strings.


      Also 鳳 沼




      18) Feet: The portion under the Dragon or head of the instrument that
      raises the soundboard of the instrument above any flat surface it is
      placed on (足, zú).


      Also Bottom Foot (底脚/底腳, dǐ jiǎo), (Wild) Goose Foot (雁足, yàn zú).

      1. Key: The tool used to turn the tuning pins (匙, Shi). The ancient
      version of this tool looked very much like an ornate door key. Also known
      as a Tuning Wrench in English.

      2. Stand: The supports on which the instrument is placed to be played (架子,
      Jiàzi). (5)

      3. String Rest: The extra strip of material running the length of the
      straight fixed bridge (弦枕, xián zhěn). It protects the fixed bridge from
      the strings and provides a cleaner sound by creating a uniform and firm
      end point for the strings' vibrations.

      4. The Hidden Chamber: The empty space in the interior of the instrument
      (隐间, yǐn jiān). Also know as Resonating Chamber in English.

      5. Lastly, the holes through which the strings pass on the top of the
      instrument seem to have a variety of names. Some of those names may be
      dependent on where the holes are. I've seen the more general 絃眼/弦眼 as well
      as 穿弦孔 for the holes that connect to the tuning pins and 挂弦孔 for the holes
      that anchor one end of the ends of the strings in the tail. Until I get
      get clarity on this I won't list out translations and full explanations.
      If you know something about these, please email me!

      (1) Most of the single character-versions of the names can also appear
      with "zheng" in front, such as "zheng head, zheng tail", etc. That's
      implied so I've left that out. Both phrasings are correct.




      (2) Translations can be really fun. I must confess I don't know if 岳 is
      being used here as "high" or "highest". I chose "high" because "highest"
      implies a comparison and I don't know what it's being compared to.




      (3) Chinese musicians who play western and traditional instruments agree,
      "马/馬" means "bridge" in this usage, not "horse". They use the same term
      for the bridge of bowed western instruments like the violin.




      (4) Zheng can have as little as one or as many two dozen sound holes
      depending on the design. Cheng 1991 claims to have made a zheng with
      dozens of small holes drilled into the backboard rather than several large
      cutouts, and I have seen similar instruments for sale with a similar
      array.




      (5) The instrument has been played many ways throughout history. It has
      been played resting on the ground, resting on the performer's legs,
      resting on a flat table or resting on stands. 架子 refers to the 2 or
      3-piece supports most commonly used for guzheng.
