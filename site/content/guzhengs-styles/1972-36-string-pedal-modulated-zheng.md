Created in 1972 by Zhang Ziyue of the Suzhou Musical Instrument Factory of Jiangsu province, pedal actuated zhengs came onto the scene to solve the same problems as the earlier modulated zheng - and had some of the same limitations.

This is a 36-string zheng made around that time, tuned in the western diatonic scale.
