This is an 18 Steel string guzheng from instrument brand JinYun. It features straight steel and wound copper strings and that sweeping C-Bridge at the tail. I have seen a similar, 21 and 23-string instruments made by the same maker with nylon strings.

Google is throwing security warnings when I try to visit their website, so I won't link directly to them from here. But you can see their url in the photo and I can tell you that the product numbers are:

18 strings - 01157

21 strings - 01018B

The 23-string instrument was reportedly a limited edition; I saw one for sale in California but could not find a product number.
