Typically about a foot or two long (30-61cm) Toy guzheng are just that - they may look the part, but they won't have 21 strings nor sound with the same power. They can be a source of joy for all ages and could well turn new generations onto the instrument. The only problem with toy guzheng come from sellers suggesting they are equivalent to a full size. A tourist may bring one home on the promise that proper tuning will unlock the instrument's hidden potential. Sadly, this is not the case.
