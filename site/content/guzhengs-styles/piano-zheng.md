Don't have enough space for a grand piano but still desire a beautifully impressive instrument? Look no further because here is the one-of-a-kind piano zheng! Well, really, it's a guzheng that sort of... fell into an empty piano... but it's still quite a sight to see!

Seen at Music China 2013 and 2018, the annual Music instrument trade fair and expo held in Shanghai every fall.
