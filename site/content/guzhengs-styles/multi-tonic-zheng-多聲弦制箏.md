The Multi-tonic Zheng 多聲弦制箏 (Duō shēng xián zhì zhēng) or Duō shēng zhēng for short (多聲箏) seems to have been made in 2011 by Professor and Guzheng performer Lǐ Méng (李萌), though my sources are not good. It's effectively two zhengs combined; there are 21 strings tuned to the diatonic scale for the right side, with 16 additional strings tuned to the pentatonic scale on the left side. The range of the two sides is roughly the same, with the 21-stringed side having a deeper A and the 16 string has a higher D. The one in the picture is from manufacturer Dunhuang, model number 697-1. A version of this instrument made an appearance at the China Music 2018 trade show.

If you excuse the biased opinion, this feels similar to a harp guitar. More strings mean theoretically greater versatility, but if well recieved music does not require it, how could this ever become popular?
