The original source and age of this zheng is unknown as its current owner purchased it at anonymous auction, but a flyer in its tuning pin compartment advertised a concert in Taipei in 1988.

This instrument has two straight fixed bridges and 16 strings of steel with 2 of the bass strings wound with copper. The backboard is curved but appears to be made of very thin plywood. The tuning pins are inside a hinged compartment. The moveable bridges have holes in their center and are threaded together on a string.
