The 4-By-Butterfly: for the guzheng ensemble that wants to add that extra flair.

Seen at the 2008 Music China event, the annual Music instrument trade fair and expo held in Shanghai every fall. It was made by the Dunhuang company. I've seen pictures of this from 2010 as well; I have the impression it's been on display several times over the years.
