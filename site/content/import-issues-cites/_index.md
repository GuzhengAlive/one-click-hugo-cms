      The guzheng has long been made of controlled species. It’s important to be
      aware of these when purchasing and especially when traveling with the
      instrument.

    text: >-
      In January 2017, all woods of the genus Dalbergia were added to “the
      Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
      Flora" (CITES) as species restricted under Appendix II. Most woods used in
      guzheng frames are from that genus. Most countries in the world adhere to
      CITES.
  - heading: What This Means
    text: >-
      The listing under Appendix II means instruments containing Dalbergia wood
      harvested after January 2017 CANNOT be shipped internationally by a
      company or business. As it takes several years of drying for wood to be
      ready for (quality) guzheng, I estimate it will take 5 years before
      instruments show up on the international market with wood harvested after
      January 2017. 




      Specifics are uncertain but GZA predicts increased prices and alternative
      woods gaining in popularity guzheng purchased after 2022. Instruments may
      become harder to find.
  - heading: Loopholes
    text: >-
      1) CITES bans commercial exporting but allows personal-use exemptions by
      weight. This means you can ship an instrument you bought in one country to
      another so long as you are not selling it in the new country and the
      amount of the controlled wood used is less than a certain weight. I'm
      unclear how that affects internet sales, but if you travel to China in
      person and buy a Dalbergia guzheng you are allowed to ship it to your home
      in a different country.




      2) Chinese authorities can declare that wood has been harvested in a
      sustainable manner and thereby exempt instruments or instrument makers
      from CITES restrictions. If they do this, we may not notice a difference
      in price or availability. If they don’t then Dalbergia instruments may
      become less common.




      Keep reading for specifics on how this impacts you.
  - heading: Traveling Internationally with Guzheng
    text: >-
      If you cross an international border with a guzheng you are technically
      importing/exporting it and thus under the realm of CITES. The American
      League of Orchestras has a thorough breakdown of how CITES affects
      traveling musicians on their website. But if you need a quicker summary:




      At the bottom of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service web page is the very
      important Appendix II, Annotation 15: "All parts and derivatives are
      included, except:... b)  Non-commercial exports of a maximum total weight
      of 10 kg. per shipment". This means that if the total weight of protected
      woods used in your instrument are less than 10kg AND it's being shipped
      for a non-commercial purpose, you're fine! You have to prove that it's a
      non commercial export, but hey, at least it's possible!




      The most likely way someone would take advantage of this would be to
      travel with the instrument. Maybe you're moving, maybe you received a gift
      while visiting with a friend, maybe you traveled to a country, bought a
      guzheng, and are now bringing it with you to keep. However it happened,
      once you become the owner of the instrument and you have no intent to sell
      it, you are export/importing it for a non-commercial purpose.




      You still have to document ownership, point of sale, and do your darnedest
      to certify that the instrument does not break any laws - but it is
      perfectly permissible to cross borders with an instrument if it is for
      your own personal use. HOWEVER: For those among you buying tickets to
      China to buy your luxury guzheng, remember: This exemption gets you out of
      CITES but you still have to pay duties, also known as import tax. As of
      2010 that fee is 4.6% of the items total value/purchase price in US
      Dollars. So if you bring your $1000 guzheng home from Asia, be aware
      you’ll owe $46 when crossing the border. 




      If you need to cross borders frequently, some border control organizations
      offer 'passports' to prove you've already paid all relevant taxes. The USA
      version is about $75 and takes 2-3 MONTHS to get approval. It's intended
      for musicians living in the US who travel internationally frequently. Plan
      ahead
  - heading: Buying Internationally
    text: >-
      In order to cross a border, that is to import and export an item made of a
      protected species, the person responsible must apply for permits with
      evidence the creation of the item did not negatively impact the species.
      That law is aimed at companies. If you are buying a guzheng or other item
      that is made of protected woods from another country, it is the seller's
      responsibility to apply for and file all the relevant paperwork both as an
      exporter from their country and an importer to yours. But as a buyer,
      realize that if the international retailer doesn't file the proper
      certifications and your purchase gets impounded at a border crossing, you
      might be without both your money and the instrument. Make sure the seller
      knows what they are doing.
  - heading: Grandfathered Instruments
    text: >-
      One key thing for collectors, buyers, and sellers to know about CITES and
      guzheng: CITES does not restrict woods retroactively. Instruments made of
      restricted wood that were created prior to the date the species was added
      to the agreement are exempt. That important date is called the "Convention
      Date". If you can prove that your guzheng was produced prior to 1992 (if
      Brazilian Rosewood) or prior to 2017 (for most other Dalbergia species)
      you can theoretically still cross borders. If you have questions, contact
      your country's customs, border, or conservation agents. For those of you
      who just bought instruments: Get your bill of sale copied, time stamped,
      and keep it with your instrument at all times. You may be thankful you
      have a way to prove the age of your instrument in the future.
  - heading: Buying Domestically
    text: >-
      The big sigh of relief: If the guzheng is already in your country the
      seller does not have to file for CITES-related permits. You can just buy
      it. Yay! In the case of many European countries, borders are often
      ignored. If the instrument is already in an European country and the the
      buyer is in an European country, no CITES permits should be required. Yay!
      Please note: I use "European" generically. You'll have to look up the
      trade agreements between the relevant countries to be safe.
  - heading: The Larger Impact of CITES and Endangered Species
    text: >-
      Guzheng importing is going to get interesting. Quality woods are typically
      harvested and dried for several years prior to usage in an instrument.
      Theoretically, the date it was harvested is what would determine if it was
      a Pre-Convention piece. With Dalbergia at large added to CITES in 2017, I
      estimate the mass market will run out of pre-convention timber by about
      2022, save for low-output makers with significant stocks. At that point,
      what happens? I honestly don't know. 




      CITES is written such that Scientific Authorities of a relevant countries
      can certify the wood was harvested in such a way that it did not damage or
      threaten the continuation of the species. Perhaps countries with money in
      the mix continue certifying woods for export without vetting the impact.
      That adds some paperwork and logistical headaches, but keeps business as
      usual for all of the good and bad that entails. If that happens, species
      populations continue to decrease and we see shortages in future decades.




      If people are serious about conserving the threatened and endangered
      species and thus kept their standard for certification high, supply of
      woods would decrease, forcing price up. There is room for that in the
      guzheng market. We are spoiled with absolutely wonderful instruments for
      less than $1000. The owners of cellos, violins, and other fine western
      instruments can tell you - compared to their $3,000, $5,000, and $10,000+
      medium-grade instruments, we are well off. While I hope prices for
      entry-level guzheng never mimic that of the cello or violin, the US market
      could stand the price increase.




      A higher price would be unpleasant, but if it meant that in 20 years we'd
      still have wood readily available and thus quality guzheng at a reasonable
      price, it would be well worth it. Remember, unlike violins guzheng tend to
      lose their finer sound qualities with time. There is a pressure on guzheng
      players; we're all going to face this.




      As to what you should make of all these woods being listed as having some
      cause for concern, well. It's important to know what impact we have on
      others. Yes, you can buy instruments made of endangered species, but by
      doing so, you are contributing to their destruction. Do you really want to
      be part of the reason why a future generation can't experience the the
      joyful sounds or appearance of some of these fine woods?




      You have a few choices:




      Option 1) Buy instruments that aren't made of endangered species. African
      Blackwood, African Padauk, Burmese Padauk, Bubinga, and Pau Rosa are Not
      Threatened and are used on medium and high-quality instruments. You can
      still get a beautiful instrument that sounds and looks amazing without
      contributing to the extinction of a species!




      Option 2) Make sure your seller/producer is harvesting sustainably
      cultivated trees. If they own their own or buy exclusively from tree farms
      that use the same land to grow and regrow their tree crops, then you can
      rest assured they are not having a net damaging effect. Going out into the
      wild and cutting down trees? Not so good. Yes, this is a harder option,
      but if you are up to the challenge you'll rest assured.




      Option 3) Contribute a sizable amount of money to conservation efforts
      specifically aimed at restoring the populations of trees that your
      instrument is made out of. I'm talking 30-50% of the cost of your
      instrument. Big money. By buying that instrument you are creating an
      economic pressure to cut down more trees. You have to create an even
      greater economic pressure to counteract that and keep trees standing or
      get new ones planted. The most cost-effective way would be to buy a tree,
      to give someone enough money so that the tree is more valuable if left
      standing. I don't know how to do that, practically. Giving to conservation
      and regrowth efforts is another option, but every step you are removed
      from the actual laborer cutting down the tree, the more of your money gets
      shunted off into bureaucracy and the less get's to the actual worker.
      Therefore, you'll have to give a greater amount to actually get enough
      money to that forester and its company to convince them to change how they
      harvest.




      Option 4) Help expand the types of woods that are considered for guzheng
      production. There are many species with interesting qualities out there,
      even some in the USA. Remember, the soundboard is not made of an
      endangered species, it's the framing that's the problem. There is more
      leeway in acoustic properties in the frame. There must be nontraditional
      woods that will create an enjoyable sound! If you know an instrument maker
      who is up to the challenge, encourage them to try a build and post their
      results to instrument maker's forums, or get them in touch with me! The
      more interest there is in trying something different the better chance we
      have of ensuring a positive future for the instrument.

      Some other names to be familiar with: The IUCN is The International Union
      for Conservation of Nature. They maintain the IUCN's Red List, a database
      of species and how much danger they are in. Though they have a history
      with the United Nations they are a reference with no legal authority. They
      are a great resource.




      CITES, "the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
      Wild Fauna and Flora" is the next step up. It is not itself a law, but if
      your country agreed to it then they have agreed to enforce laws that mimic
      what CITES says. If you're in one of the 183 countries that upholds CITES
      (spoiler alert: you probably are) then CITES will tell you which animal
      and plant products need special permits to cross international borders.




      CITES was first drafted at a 1963 meeting by members of the IUCN. It was
      first agreed to in 1975 by 80 countries including the US. The intent was
      to restrict trade in plants and animals that were endangered so as to keep
      those species alive longer. The list of species protected and the extent
      each is protected changes periodically. China joined in 1981.




      January 2017 saw the addition of all woods in the Dalbergia genus to the
      CITES agreement. That is a genus that many if not most guzheng frame woods
      come from. Some previous Dalbergia species had been on the list prior to
      2017. Dalbergia nigra, Brazilian Rosewood, was added to the CITES
      agreement in 1992 under Appendix I protection. Trade of any object made of
      this wood created after 1992 is illegal. Demand for it was high but new
      seedlings were just refusing to grow. That is a recipe for extinction,
      hence its listing.  There were a few other Dalbergia species with Appendix
      II protection pre 2017, but no guzheng-relevant species in Appendix III.




      To go in-depth yourself, visit the CITES website. In the USA CITES is
      administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Lists of every species
      currently protected in the United States are available on the  US FWS
      website and provide a lengthy discussion of issues relating to crossing
      borders with items made of restricted materials. I’ve summarized the
      important tidbits below. Make sure you read to the end.
