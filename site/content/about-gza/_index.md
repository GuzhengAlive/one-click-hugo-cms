      There are thousand of works written about the guzheng in Chinese languages
      but quality English language sources are hard to find. Let's change that.




      It is my desire to make the guzheng accessible to a wider audience. One
      way to do that is to create a place where people can discover the
      instrument at their own pace. I work to detail the history of the guzheng,
      its music, and the people who make up its past and present. Yet, I am only
      one person. I have and will continue to put my best effort into this, but
      to truly tell these stories I need and welcome the community's help.




      If you have history, stories, or experiences, please send me an email.
      There's a form at the bottom of every page to do so. If you know of books
      or publications, tell me about them! Even if you have only your own
      experiences and a few moments to share your story, please, please do so! I
      would be happy to speak with you. I alone am incapable of telling this
      instrument's story but together, through many shared voices, we can make
      something wonderful.




      To keep this undertaking manageable I have two guidelines. 1) I focus on
      English Language resources. It's easier for me to understand and it
      prevents me from being overwhelmed with the massive bulk of historic and
      contemporary writings in Chinese. 2) I am trying not to create teaching
      material. You can and should learn to play the guzheng!  But there are
      already teachers all over the world who are ready, willing, and able to
      provide lessons in person or online. I hope this website becomes a
      reference for knowledge of all sorts, but you will need a true teacher to
      guide you to understanding.

    text: >-
      One big issue limiting how many people learn about the guzheng is how
      rarely the instrument is mentioned in English-language books. So why is
      that? Well, the first challenge is that the majority of events surrounding
      the guzheng took place in China. China, my friends, is very big(*). China
      has many native languages, none of which are English. Writers seeking to
      describe the history and culture of China need a person (or a team) who
      can operate in all relevant Chinese languages. If they assemble that team
      they discover China is overwhelming in its culture, history, and size.
      With so much to learn and so much to explain, well, some things fall by
      the wayside.


      But there's a bit more to it then that. Western audiences have regarded
      music from China as an exotic oddity to be stared at and dismissed.(1)
      When we humans encounter something that is different enough, we tend to
      believe that the different thing is lesser. We see this wherever cultures
      encounter difference; it's the negative connotation beneath the word
      "foreigner". With enough exposure humans do get past the "it's not like
      mine" and enjoy other culture on their own merits, but it's been difficult
      for English speakers to gain enough exposure to the history and culture of
      China to get over that resistance. 


      That is changing.


      Modern technology has made mountains of information accessible to people
      with an internet connection. Travel to China is newly accessible with
      improved visa agreements, and flights to China can fall to incredibly low
      prices in the off seasons. A project like Guzheng Alive was not possible
      20 years ago. Even 10 years ago this would have been challenging to the
      point of overwhelming. But today is a different story. Join me on this
      journey.


      Notes


      (*): Citation needed.


      (1) there are researchers who have acted as exceptions but they prove the
      point: When you can only point to a handful of respectful, factually
      accurate works, it highlights just how few exist.

  - heading: What about Wikipedia and other websites?
    text: >-
      There are sources about the guzheng on the internet but most aren't in
      English, lack depth, contradict each other, or area a combination of all
      three. You can see it for yourself: type "guzheng" into your favorite
      search engine and see what turns up. I will bet the first ten results are
      either Wikipedia, digital storefronts selling guzheng, or pages of guzheng
      musicians. The Wikipedia article is a disappointing ramble that sources
      very little and confuses more than it informs. All the other pages offer
      incomplete tidbits that, even taken together, provide what I believe are
      inaccurate impressions of the history of this instrument. The musicians'
      pages are more interesting and coherent than the storefronts but cut their
      explanations short. That's understandable but it leaves a massive gap.
      Deeper in the search results you'll find enthusiasts' pages extolling the
      virtues of the instrument, but they are too low in the search results for
      people to find them. Such is the challenge: Unless you are selling
      something or are Wikipedia, primacy in search is a hard nut to crack.




      Speaking of that wonderful, terrible, most accessible resource in the
      world, you may wonder why I don't improve Wikipedia's guzheng article
      myself. Mainly: the limitations. Wikipedia has guidelines which force
      articles to become boring. More broadly, Wikipedia is not intended to be a
      gathering place for communities. It tries to separate facts from people in
      a way I think harms the conversation around parts of life where the people
      are so integral.




      Other issues: Wikipedia discourages or outright prohibits referencing
      theses, offering speculations, and reporting on original work. The most
      informative English-language sources are currently theses and I do enjoy
      me some speculation, so Wikipedia and I would clash. Further, there is the
      specter of editors with conflicts of interest coming in and distorting
      information to their gain, which is part of the reason why the Wikipedia
      article is currently such a mess. I don't want this resource to be at the
      mercy of anonymous promoters.




      All that said: Since about 2009 the English [Wikipedia Guzheng
      page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng) has averaged upwards of [300
      views a
      day](http://www.wikishark.com/title/en/Guzheng?text_search=&gtype=0&factors=&view=1),
      and currently sits at about [10k+ user views per
      month](https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&start=2015-07&end=2017-07&pages=Guzheng).
      I'm not opposed to helping those visitors learn more, but I don't want to
      focus my efforts there.

    text: >-
      I am an enthusiast, a non-professional player of this instrument. This
      website started because I asked questions and couldnâ€™t find the answers.
      Once I found them I figured there were other people who would like to know
      the answers too. It has been my good fortune to find or be given the work
      of brilliant scholars the world over. My limited knowledge of Chinese
      languages is a barrier - wouldn't it be great if I could just translate
      everything from interviews with primary sources? But, we work with the
      skills we have.




      I am not an expert. My skills are at finding and displaying information.
      The experts are the amazing scholars and performers I pull from. Some have
      invested their whole lives and all of them deserve the utmost respect. I
      owe each and every one of them a heartfelt thank you. You can find out
      more about them on the Experts page and get a sense for the scope of their
      scholarship from the Bibliography page.




      Join me in this adventure! Music is about community, about sharing
      knowledge and insight across generations. In today's age it's also about
      sharing across cultures and continents. I would love to see this story
      grow to include more perspectives. Please correct any wrongs you find,
      offer insight, or ask questions of your own through the form at the bottom
      of this and every page. You can use it to send me an email! Thank you for
      all that you offer.
  - heading: On Affiliation and Support
    text: >-
      This project and the author are not affiliated with any of the entities
      mentioned on this site. I have not received any financial or in-kind
      support from any of the people, places, or organizations I mention. I
      create and maintain this site on my own. The businesses I link to are
      there because of the information they share, be those words, photographs,
      or videos. I mention Carol Chang and ChineseZither.net extensively because
      she has been one of the most thoughtful sources of publicly available
      information, both through her company and through various communities and
      forums. She is active and present as well; while most sources are now
      reference books for the ages, she continues to explore and provide more
      information through her business.




      It may seem strange that I offer so much praise for someone with
      commercial interests in promoting the guzheng. Perhaps because of that
      interest, Carol Chang has been one of the greatest contributors to people
      who are new to the instrument and its music. From a commercial side, her
      business is the best-establihed guzheng retailers in the United States,
      and the only Online storefront that I know of that puts the guzheng first.




      There are other sellers out there; I am sure there are real world guzheng
      stores with wonderful professionals at the helm who would be more than
      happy to offer what they know, and I know of domestic storefronts based in
      California, Washington D.C., and at least two in Canada, but I don't see
      them sharing their knowledge. Carol Chang's work, on the other hand, is
      extensive and accessible. I owe her a debt of gratitude for the work and
      care she puts into what she does, and I seek to recognize how much I have
      relied on her contributions to the community across this site.




      Show me another English-language storefront with an equally wholesome
      approach and I will celebrate them too. Until then, thank goodness for
      Carol Chang!
