  Below are a few resources to get you started writing your own guzheng sheet
  music in Jiànpù (简朴).

      The fastest way to get your music on paper is to write it by hand. Here
      are [sheet music
      templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kidm8DMZLw4PrtJ2ZzitmXzfkJwjtIMt?usp=sharing)
      you can print out to write your music. See the Finger Techniques page for
      the technique symbols.

      The sad fact of the matter is there is not a lot of English-language
      software that both know the rules of cypher notation formatting and are
      easy to use. I know of only two. Both are free but both have drawbacks. If
      you have coding knowledge, consider joining the third option which is
      currently under development.




      Now, in 2011 MusicXML 3.0 was released with partial support for jianpu /
      cypher notation, so technology is slowly moving in that direction, but I
      have yet to find software that fully supports writing in it.

      Windows has the [Simplified Musical Notation Input System,
      SimpErhu](http://simperhu.weebly.com/download.html) for short. It plugs
      into and requires Microsoft Word. It's a macro-enabled template you can
      add to Microsoft Word that gives you shortcuts and additional menus to
      create cipher notation, staves, and the various glyphs and 汉字 comments.
      Instructions are provided in English and Mandarin.




      Technically this works on Macs as well as it does plugin to Microsoft Word
      for Mac, but the only version I have tested it on is 2011. I imagine it
      would work better with Office for Mac 2016 / Office 365 but I can't
      confirm.  On 2011 only half of the functions and glyphs integrate. It's
      still useable, but there are many hotkeys that conflict with the defaults
      in Mac OS.  




      Summary: SimpErhu is fast to get started in and easy to navigate, but is
      limited to transcribing existing scores. Requires Microsoft Word.

      MAC OS has the powerful NoteabilityPro. Originally a multi-hundred dollar
      composing suite created by a partnership between a composer and a
      programmer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, it has now
      been released for free. [Download it before they change their
      minds!!!](http://debussy.music.ubc.ca/download.html) I joke, but this is
      some seriously capable software. It's everything you need to compose full
      scores and will even play the music back to you. This, for me, has been
      huge. Suddenly I can practice multi-part pieces even when other musicians
      aren't available!




      A major caveat: Noteability Pro spaces notes based on duration- just like
      in staff music, a whole note has more space after it than an eighth note.
      Most jianpu scores I have seen group notes based on beat - so regardless
      of duration, all notes that fill out a beat are printed together. There is
      not currently a way to adjust that spacing.




      Summary: NoteabilityPro takes more time to get started in but it rewards
      you with far more features. Chief among them: you can listen to your
      score, allowing you to catch transcription errors you might not have
      otherwise noted. And you know, everything else you might need to create
      80-staff compositions!

      This is in active development. When I first wrote this page in 2017
      [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en/download) was unable to create cipher
      notation. As of May 2018 a great deal of work has been done, making this
      something to watch. I have not yet had the chance to use the new version
      that includes jianpu support, but you can get it free
      [here](https://musescore.org/en/download). You can get a look at its
      development on [Github
      here](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/pull/3614). There is also a
      [plugin](https://github.com/sirsoweird/jianpu-plugin/), though I am unsure
      how it relates.
