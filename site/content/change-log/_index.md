      Guzheng Alive is a living project. Sections are modified frequently with
      new sections added every month based on information availability,
      community requests, and author interest. Feel free to request topics! 


      The Change Log does not represent work that is ongoing; items only appear
      once they are complete. This leads to some fun artifacts like the only
      line for October 2018 being an expansion of the repertoire. The effort
      that took, including an actual trip to China, scanning sources, character
      recognition, proofing, cross referencing, and programming is all contained
      in that single line.


      My biggest hurdle, currently, is how to showcase all of this information.
      The most challenging topic to present is the actual music. It is difficult
      to make it appealing without being overwhelming. Let me know if you have
      any ideas!
