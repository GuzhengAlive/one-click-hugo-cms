      You’re learning to play. You want something fun! But all your teacher will
      give you are practice pieces. Where can you get guzheng sheet music?
      Answer: Lot’s of places!

      Guzheng.cn is my top recommendation for guzheng sheet music. It allows you
      to search for sheet music for songs as well as to find recordings and
      videos to learn from. If you are at a loss of where to start, head over to
      our Repertoire page, find a song at the right level for you, and click the
      “Guzheng.cn” link. It will take you to a search for that song on
      guzheng.cn. The first category in the search results, 视频, is video. The
      second, 古筝曲, is audio recordings, and the third category, 古筝谱, is the
      sheet music.




      There are more websites with sheet music than just guzheng.cn. Here are
      five more recommendations:




      * http://gzq.guzhengw.cn/ subdivides their music into school or style. Use
      your trusty web translator to find songs from Henan, Shandong, Chaozhou,
      and others.

      * http://pu.guqu.net/ - more about folk music and older songs.

      * http://www.cnscore.com - general purpose, all instruments.

      * http://www.jianpu.cn/ - general purpose, many instruments, but written
      in cypher notation. 

      * http://www.yueqixuexi.com/ - general purpose, all instruments.




      These sites really shine when searching for covers of TV and movie theme
      songs, popular music, and the old classics. Covers of western songs are
      harder to find.

      Physical music books are totally viable! Your first option would be to go
      to one of the stores on the Retailers page and order from them. They
      should be able to help you pick from among their selection. Most stores
      offer collections of songs, learning materials, and practice exercises.
      Remember, you don’t need to limit yourself to English - all you need is to
      be able to read the music!


      If you do want English descriptions of what you are doing then there are 6
      English titles that I know of, 3 of which are produced by the US guzheng
      shops themselves:


      * An Introduction to the Gu-Zheng Volume 1, Volume 2, Volume 3, Volume 4

      * Bei Bei’s Easiest GuZheng Course

      * Gu Zheng Sessions Vol.1 - a Beginner’s Guide to Playing the Chinese
      Zither

      * Sound of China Guzheng Basic Tutorial - (review)

      * Teaching Foreigners to Play Guzheng - (review) Published by Anhui but
      appears to only be available through resellers.

      * How to Play Guzheng, the Chinese Zither: The Basic Skills (I do not
      recommend this; from my understanding it is overly simplified, very short,
      and does not offer much in the way of musical scores.)


      You don’t have to limit yourself to English though. Sheet music is its own
      language. Amazon would be your easiest source for Chinese music books.
      Search for 古筝 or guzheng and limit your results to books. You’ll have
      plenty to choose from.

      If you are using a specific site search or even a general search engine it
      may be helpful to know that sheet music often has a naming convention of
      "Name (instrument details)" such as Fisherman's Song (guzheng part) or
      Fisherman's Song (Guzheng Erhu duo). Build your own queries with the words
      below:


      * Guzheng: 古筝

      * Erhu: 二胡

      * Dizi: 笛子

      * Bamboo Flute: 竹笛

      * Duo: 二重奏

      * Trio: 三重奏

      * Ensemble: 合奏

      * Part: 分谱

      * Orchestral Score: 管弦乐队分谱

      * Score (General term): 曲谱

      * Folk Music Scores: 民歌曲谱

      Chances are someone out there already has the sheet music you are looking
      for. Ask around in your community or contact a local ensemble or teacher.
      Musicians often have stacks of old sheet music and many would be happy to
      photocopy a page or two. Maybe offer to scan all of their old music in
      exchange for using the copies for your personal enjoyment.




      Please note: Many scores are hand written due to a lack of easily
      accessible cipher music notation software. Make sure you get appropriate
      permission and credit before using them. Even if it’s the transcription of
      a classic, ancient song, someone took the time to write it down. They
      deserve credit for their work.
