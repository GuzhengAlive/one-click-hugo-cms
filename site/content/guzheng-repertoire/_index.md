      Music was generally passed without writing it down so records are scarce.
      The earliest known record of solo zheng scores is actually found in a
      Japanese manuscript from around the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE). The first
      modern attempt to document and publish guzheng music in particular came in
      the 1920s. (Lau 2006). A man named Huáng Shí (黃石) published a lithograph
      entitled Zhōngzhōu Gǔ Diào (中州鼓調) which contained three Henan zheng pieces
      in a modified form of gōngchěpǔ (工尺谱) notation. Huáng added beat and
      rhythm markings to the notes to make the structure of the music clearer.


      Another man, Wei Ziyau (魏子猶, Wèi zi yóu), created but did not publish a
      set of 10 or so Henan zheng pieces in a mimeograph he titled Zhōngzhōu Gǔ
      Diào (中州古調). He did distribute to those he knew.


      It wasn’t until 1938 that a set of zheng musical scores was published
      widely. Liáng Tsài-píng (梁在平) published “Proposed Zheng Scores” (擬箏譜, Nǐ
      zhēng pǔ) which contained 15 zheng pieces in gōngchěpǔ notation. Liáng’s
      work was noticed and sparked documentation efforts that continue to this
      day.

      Approximations of each song's difficulty is in the "Level" column. Players
      of Chinese instruments can sit for exams produced by the Central
      Conservatory of Music (中央音樂學院). These exams run from the simplest, 1, to
      the most complex, 10. 10 is also referred to as “Performance” level. To
      pass a level 1 exam students must play several Level 1 songs; to pass
      level 2, several level 2 songs, and so on.


      I have also added a column for Attribution, that is, where these songs
      come from. Most are identified with a region of China, each with its own
      musical style. Some songs are so old and widespread they are listed only
      as “Ancient”, while others are adaptations of foreign songs. When a song
      is more closely associated with a person than with a region the person’s
      name is listed.


      All of this information comes from published books of songs, exam
      materials, as well as names of songs pulled from guzheng theses. Sources
      are described in the "Sources" blind. 


      Different versions of the same song exist. They can be made more or less
      complex or they can be played in different styles. For simplicity I have
      combined these entries with commas.


      If you have level information for any of the ones marked "ungraded" or you
      feel the grading numbers given to a given song are too far off, please
      send me an email and I'll make changes.
