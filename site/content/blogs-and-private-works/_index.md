      A delightfully personal project sharing the experiences of one community
      member in Chinese and English! Topics include perspectives on nails,
      books, teaching sources, and more. It’s exciting to see where the author
      is heading in 2019!

      A recent addition to the landscape! The work of this author gets
      excitingly technical. If you’d rather go all in on the qin (we won’t hold
      it against you) their Guqin Resources page has some astounding, truly
      incredible resources.

      An absolute must - the creation of a carbon fiber qin. Important note: If
      you desire to create your own carbon fiber composite please take the time
      to learn how to handle its ingredients safely. That is a material that
      should be attempted only with proper safety equipment and handling
      knowledge.
