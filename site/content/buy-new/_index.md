      Expect to spend $400-$900 on your first guzheng. Stick to one of the big
      three brands: Dunhuang, Tianyi, or Scarlet Bird (Zhuque). A $400-$600
      instrument should list Rosewood for the frame. A $600-$900 instrument
      should list something exotic sounding like Paduk, Bubinga, Sandalwood,
      African Blackwood or similar. Both price ranges should list Paulownia,
      Wutong, Paotong, or Firmiana Simplex for the soundboard. Make sure your
      guzheng comes with stands and a soft case. Those are expensive to buy
      separate. Also make sure you receive or order a tuning wrench and nails.

      To pick the guzheng that’s right for you, you need to understand:



      * Your price range.
      * Guzheng descriptions.
      * What a Reasonable Price is.

      Guzheng are arranged into Tiers, like “Student”, “Professional”, etc.
      Every store uses different terms so we’ll use price instead.




      **Tier 0**: <$400. **Tier 1**: $400-$600. **Tier 2**: $600-$900. **Tier
      3**: $900-$1500. **Tier 4**: $1,500-$4,000. **Tier 5**: $4,000-$20,000+. 




      The first thing to know is that “cheap” does not mean “bad”. The guzheng
      is relatively easy to make and still produce fantastic music. All of these
      tiers will last for years if you take care of them.




      **Tier 0** are almost always “travel-sized”. They are the cheapest because
      they are smaller and use less and cheaper material. 




      **Tier 1** instruments from reputable sellers are ideal for students,
      especially if you are unsure of how committed the student is. Decorations
      and finishes are simpler to keep costs down. The individual notes may not
      be as clear or ring as long as higher tiers but you’ll still have a great
      time. After about 2 years your ear and skill will have developed enough
      you might appreciate an upgrade. 




      **Tier 2** instruments sound better than Tier 1 guzheng and have more
      effort in their decorations. More attention is paid to the soundboards,
      tuning them to produce stronger bass or treble notes. In guzheng talk,
      people say the sound is “bright” when it has stronger high notes and
      “dark” when it has stronger low notes. You may want to buy in this price
      range if you have a very critical ear and/or already know what type of
      sound you want.




      **Tier 3**: Most first-time buyers pick Tier 1 or 2. Buying a Tier 3 for a
      new student is like buying a convertible for a first-time driver. It’s a
      nice luxury but is more than a new student needs. Instrument makers
      customize the sound characteristics of the Tier 3 instruments to fit
      specific tonalities. Once you’re in Tier 3 you’ll consider things like the
      genre of music you prefer to play, the techniques you use, and of course,
      how the guzheng looks. But again - Tier 1 or 2 is GZA’s recommendation for
      a first instrument.




      **Tier 4 and 5**: Extending the car metaphor, Tiers 4 and 5 are the likes
      of Rolls-Royce or a Bentley. Their artistry will immediately impress you,
      but to fully appreciate what they are you need to know a lot about guzheng
      and how to play them.

    text: >-
      Once you determine what tier instrument you want to buy you’ll need to
      understand how they are described. A typical guzheng seller will list: the
      frame wood, brand, and soundboard wood; provide pictures of the
      decorations, and list what accessories are included.




      ## Frame


      Frame woods are advertised first, usually in the title. They determine the
      look of the instrument with ~some impact on the sound. Tier 1 instruments
      will be labeled “rosewood”. This is a generic term for many red-tinted
      woods. They are interchangeable so people don’t keep track. Starting with
      Tier 2, expect to see specific woods named like Paduk, Bubinga, and
      others. If a Tier 2 instrument lists Rosewood it might be overpriced, or
      the seller might not have the correct translation for the actual wood. Ask
      for the Chinese characters and search them in the database on the Woods
      page to see what it actually is.




      ## Brand


      The Top 3 Guzheng brands are Dunhuang, Tianyi, and Scarlet Bird (Zhuque).
      Buy from one of them and you’ll be fine. There are dozens if not hundreds
      of other brands out there, all with different levels of craftsmanship and
      value for the price. Go outside the top 3 and you’ll risk getting
      something that under performs - but then again, maybe you find a great
      value. Some stores will custom order instruments and create their own
      brands. These can provide great value for a lower price but relies on the
      store’s expertise.




      ## Soundboard


      “Paulownia” is the standard wood for the soundboard of all guzheng,
      regardless of tier. You may also see Wutong, Firmiana Simplex, or Paotong,
      they are effectively synonyms. You can read the details on the Woods page.
      Any other wood is unusual and may indicate something strange is going on.




      ## Decorations


      Decorations come in all shapes and sizes including polished wood, printed
      graphics, paintings, fabric, carvings, stone inlays, and various other.
      Beauty (and value) is in the eye of the beholder. The more you look at
      guzheng the more you’ll get a feel for the quality of artwork in each
      tier. It can be hard to guess the decoration method from photos - is a
      decoration painted on an instrument, screen printed on, or inlaid? Take a
      careful look and ask the seller. It’s important to be happy with what you
      buy.




      ## Accessories


      Most new guzheng come with everything you need to start playing: Beginning
      nails, stands, a soft case, and a tuning wrench. Missing any of these four
      will make your life difficult. Some sellers add goodies like tuners, extra
      strings, brushes, and similar accessories. They are nice, but only add
      about $50 USD to the value. You can buy them elsewhere if needed.




      If you feel overwhelmed, that’s okay. Let's summarize.
  - heading: Is the Price Reasonable?
    text: >-
      If you are buying guzheng in the $400-$600 range (Tier 1) expect the
      listing to say it is made of Paulownia and Rosewood. Tier 2 instruments
      ($600-$900) will have Paulownia soundboards and a more specific exotic
      frame wood. If a Tier 2 has Rosewood listed, something is up. If a Tier 1
      has anything besides Rosewood listed, something is up.

      That’s the basics for buying a new instrument. There’s always more you can
      learn.




      ## On Sound Samples, Video Recordings


      Stores often record videos of their instrument being played to give an
      idea of the sound. These are better than nothing but don’t capture the
      full sound of the instrument. The sound you are hearing has gone through a
      microphone, software encoding, compression, video processing, software
      decoding, and speakers all before it gets to you. The sound loses some of
      itself at every step along that journey. If you are torn between two
      instruments the best thing you can do is visit both in person. Beyond
      that, just remember that the guzheng you buy may sound a bit different
      from the one that came out of your speakers. 




      ## Sound Characteristics


      Some sellers try to describe the sound of their instruments. Here are a
      few words you are likely to see:




      **Resonant**: The instrument vibrates audibly for a long time. Every
      guzheng resonates, some longer than others.




      **Clear**: The primary frequencies of a string are significantly louder
      than their secondary frequencies. If our ears pick up the main frequencies
      easily we say it is ‘clear’.




      **Muddy**: The opposite of clear, the primary note is much closer in
      volume to the secondary notes. At one point in history “muddy” was the
      preferred quality.




      **Deep, Dark**: Emphasized bass notes.




      **Bright, Light**: Emphasized treble notes.
