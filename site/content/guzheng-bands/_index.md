      Here is a map of guzheng ensembles and bands playing in North America.
      This exists in large part due to the work of [Chinese Music in North
      America](https://www.facebook.com/chinesemusicinnorthamerica/) group and
      their [List of ensembles playing Chinese music in North
      America](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TIpcGs6kNUEXPynkGinXkEsrE5ulSU-aWS48gi3k2lg/).
      Attend a show! You will be glad you did.




      If you know of other bands or ensembles that should be included or
      discover any information is out of date, please send me an email.
