Dr. Deyuan Zheng (or Te-yuan Cheng as is written in his thesis) provided such a systematic description of changes to guzheng designs over the years it enabled me to fill out the Pre-Modern section of the Timeline. He also provided great insight into construction techniques which lead to the Construction page.

In 2008 he was serving as Dean of the College of Music at Tainan National University of the Arts as referenced in Annex 2 of [Singapore's National Chinese Music Competition 2008](https://www.nac.gov.sg/dam/jcr:1ac4f44e-51c7-47ea-bea0-1e52106bdc17). I do not know where he is today.
