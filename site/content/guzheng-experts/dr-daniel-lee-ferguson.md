Now at Columbia University and Hunter College (part of the City University of New York), it's Dr. Daniel Lee Ferguson's work that provided the starting point for documenting the many fingering techniques of the guzheng. His thesis is very dear to me because I found it while perusing the shelves of a university's library. It felt like the discovery of a buried treasure.
