So many people owe their awareness and appreciation of the guzheng here in America to Carol Chang. She is the founder and proprietor of the "Sound of China Guzheng Music Promotion Center" in Hacienda Heights, California. She publishes a list of teachers around the country (and world!) through which I found my first guzheng teacher. Her store is where I ordered my first guzheng from.

Over the last 10 years Carol Chang has answered an exhausting range of questions on her forum with a depth and clarity unlike anything I've seen before. She has offered purchasing tips, helped players around the world understand the instrument, talked to those interested about their needs, and helped them troubleshoot all sorts of issues. 

Carol Chang has also published massive sets of photographs from factory tours and the annual Music China trade show in Shanghai. I am repeatedly impressed at the level of detail her replies go into and the time she has taken to respond to so many messages. A new post from Carol is sure to reveal new layers to facts I thought I already  understood. Learning from her reminds me how big the world of this instrument is and how little I know. I owe her a deep debt of gratitude for all that she has done.

Carol Chang's articles led directly to the Woods and Drying pages, have led to the planning of several more pages, and her discussions on various forums have helped me understand technical aspects of the instrument I would never have otherwise considered. She also hosts a one-of-a-kind list of guzheng teachers around the world.
