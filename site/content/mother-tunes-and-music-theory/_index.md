      Music Theory can be intimidating but we’ll get through this together,
      thanks in large part to the excellent discussion in Han 2013.




      Understanding the foundation or structure of music can add new layers of
      enjoyment to your listening experience. Let’s get into the underlying
      structures that traditional guzheng music uses.
  - heading: Mother Tunes - Bā Bǎn (八板)(Eight Beat)
    text: >-
      The underpinning of traditional guzheng music (and many other genres of
      traditional Chinese music) is based on a simplified structure of measures
      and beats that is then customized for each song AND each artist’s
      rendition of a song. That basic structure is called a “mother tune” or
      “bone tune”. This is commonly referred to by its romanized name “Baban”
      (Eight Beat). To explain all this I’ll need to mix in some English terms
      so Chinese scholars, forgive me.




      A Baban tune starts with 68 measures, each with an emphasized beat (bǎn,
      板). These are then grouped into 8 phrases (bǎn, 板). That’s not a typo -
      “bǎn” can mean both emphasized beat and phrase. I don’t know why it is
      translated as “beat” in the word “baban” but it is. 




      Phrases #1-4 have 8 measures and 8 beats. Phrase #5 has 12 measures, and
      then #6-8 are back to having 8 measures. That gets us to the total of 68.
      Each measure has 1-2 notes, leaving us with 100+ notes in a single mother
      tune. Here is a Baban mother tune from Han 2013:

      Once you have selected the mother tune you wish to work from, the next
      thing to do is to modify it by adding, subtracting, or injecting notes.
      Modern Chinese musicologists call this process **biànzòu** (变奏) “to vary”
      or “play with change”. Regional zheng musicians had their own terms for
      this. In Shandong and Henan it was “To add flowers” (**jiāhuā**, 加花). In
      Chaozhou it’s “To make phrases” (**zàojù**, 造句) and in Hakka traditions it
      was called “adding characters” (**tiānzì**, 添字) and “subtracting
      characters” (**jiǎn zì**, 减字).




      Let’s talk through some examples and show how you can use the same mother
      tune to create different songs.
  - heading: Adding Flowers
    text: >-
      A common way to build on a mother tune is “adding flowers to the original
      beats” (**yuánbǎn jiāhuā**, 原板加花), a process of putting new notes between
      the originals in the mother tune, and then shifting or removing the
      original notes. An example from Han 2013:


      ![Adding Flowers from Han
      2013](/img/baban-adding-flowers-example-han-2013.jpg "Example of “adding
      flowers to the original beats”, Han 2013")


      The top line is 8 measures from the song “Universal Celebration”
      (**pǔtiāntóngqìng**, 普天同庆). The bottom line shows those same 8 measures
      from a mother tune, which happens to be the same tune we showed earlier.
      In measure 1 the mother tune shows two 3’s, both eighth notes. In
      “Universal Celebration” we see an octave pair of 3’s played as an eighth
      note followed by a fast glissando of 4 higher notes, set as about 32nd
      notes. The first 3 is captured in that octave, but the second is removed
      in favor of the glissando.




      Measure 2 keeps the first note the same, but replaces the second note in
      the measure with a lower one. Measure 3 has the same first note but adds a
      second note one octave higher. And then we get to the fourth measure. Here
      the song has 1) added additional notes before the mother tune’s own, 2)
      adjusted the notes from the mother tune one octave higher, and 3) played
      all of these notes twice as fast to keep them in that 68 - measure
      structure. All of these changes are fair game. And there are more to come!
  - heading: Adding Weak Beats
    text: >-
      Mother tunes can be lengthened by adding sets of notes with unemphasized
      beats. A set of notes that do not have an emphasized beat are called yǎn
      (眼). So, the technique is called "Adding Weak Beats", **Tiānyǎn** (添眼).
      This lengthening typically doubles or quadruples the length of the
      original song. To double the length, one yǎn is added after every bǎn. To
      quadruple, three yan are added after every ban.  Both of these patterns
      have names. When there is one ban for every yan it is called **yībǎn
      yīyǎn** (一板一眼) “one ban one yan”. When there is one ban for every three
      yan it is called **yibǎn sānyǎn** (一板三眼) “one ban three yan”. Based on a
      reference by Han 2013 (page 53) I believe you could even add seven yan
      after every ban (**yībǎn qīyǎn**, 一板七眼).
  - heading: Slowing Down the Beat and Adding Flowers
    text: >-
      In addition to lengthening the mother tune with unemphasized beats (yan)
      you can change its meter or tempo to really draw it out. This is called
      "Slowing Down the Beat and Adding Flowers" (**fàngmànjiāhuā**, 放慢加花).
      Let’s say you added one yan after every ban (yiban yiyan). That would make
      the song twice as long as the original mother tune. You could then double
      the duration of every measure or beat, leading to a song that is four
      times longer than the original. An example from the wonderful Han 2013:


      ![Example of slowing down and adding
      flowers.](/img/slowing-and-adding-example-fangmanjiahua-han-2013.jpg
      "Example of Fangmanjiahua, the combination of adding unemphasized beats
      and slowing down the tempo.")


      This example is the opening of the song “Han Palace in the Autumn Moon”
      (**Hàngōng Qiūyuè**, 汉宫秋月) which is derived from the same baban mother
      tune we used for “Universal Celebration”. Here we can see that 1) every
      beat has been doubled in duration and 2) the measures have been expanded
      to cover two beats. On the time signature side that takes us from the
      original 1/4 to 2/4 (doubling) and then to 4/4 (capturing two beats in
      each measure). As you read through you’ll also notice that the other
      modifications we’ve covered appear here as well - a fast glissando is
      added in the first measure and various other notes have been replaced or
      rearranged. Again, you can do a lot with a mother tune.
  - heading: Subtracting Beats
    text: >-
      The last modification to discuss is the concept of "subtracting beats"
      (**jiǎnzì**, 减字 “subtracting characters”). Beats are typically subtracted
      after the overall structure has been expanded with **fàngmànjiāhuā**
      (放慢加花). This speeds the piece through its progression in a way that Han
      2013 refers to as “Contracting beats and/or density”. I must confess, I
      don’t have a good grasp of this other than to say you remove whole beats
      and play what remains at a faster pace.
  - heading: Baban Variants
    text: >-
      As I hope you appreciate by this time, variation is welcome and
      appreciated in traditional Chinese music. Variations of the structure of
      Baban are included in that. Over the years there have been formal variants
      of baban structure that range from 42 emphasized beats (ban) to 76. That
      gets us outside the scope of this writing but you are welcome to read Han
      2013’s original discussion in footnote 55 on page 50.




      And there is your introduction the Chinese Musical theory and the
      structure of Baban! There is loads more to tell, of course, but we’ll
      leave this here for now.
