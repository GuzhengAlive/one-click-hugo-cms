      Strings control a guzheng’s timbre. Modern instruments are usually strung
      with "Nylon" strings which are actually a core of drawn steel, a winding
      of copper (for bass strings), a tight thread layer, and then a final nylon
      winding. The ends are wound in an additional layer of thread and shaped
      for the anchors. Other materials have been used throughout the ages. Read
      on to learn about different materials, string gauges if you need to
      replace them, and how to take care of your instrument’s strings.

      Nylon strings are the most common because it is:




      * Relatively cheap to make

      * Can be made of consistent quality

      * Durable, last longer

      * Is more comfortable to play

      * Has a well-rounded sound

      * Can be held at a higher tension, producing a louder sound and allowing
      for faster play styles.




      Compare that with the other materials:
  - heading: Drawn Wire
    text: >-
      Effectively the core of the modern string, drawn wire strings were made of
      steel, steel wound in copper, straight copper, or brass. Metal strings are
      more durable than silk, easier to produce consistently, and louder. Their
      timbre is described as bright, emphasizing higher frequencies that can be
      unpleasant to the listener. Left-hand ornamentations can be painful to
      play. 




      Drawn wire strings transmit the nuance of left-handed techniques better
      than nylon but not as well as silk. Tensions are generally lower,
      preventing the instrument from being used for modern, faster songs.

      Silk was considered one of the best materials for strings for a very long
      time. It transmits nuances that metal and nylon strings simply do not
      capture. However:




      Silk strings are expensive and prone to breaking. They are quieter and
      require frequent tuning. They are kept at a lower tension in order to
      emphasize fine nuances, prohibiting modern, fast techniques.  Silk strings
      are said to have a 'dull' tone that does not transmit higher frequencies
      as well as metal strings. Sources: Cheng 1991, Han 2013




      There is a strong sense of culture and history thanks to China's
      connection to silk but it is rarely used today.

    text: >-
      While rarely discussed in modern English sources, strings were made from
      whatever materials people had on hand. The guzheng manufacturer Tianyi
      published an overview referencing animal hair and animal "tendon" being
      used as strings:




      >
      历史上的古筝弦经历过几个阶段，较早是一般使用动物的筋风干为弦（鹿筋），也有以动物的毛发为弦（马尾），这类弦的优点是声音柔和，缺点是音量小，易走音，使用寿命短.

      > The zither string has gone through several stages in its history. Early
      on strings were made of dried deer tendon \[species: Cervus elaphus] or
      hair from the deer's tail. The advantage of these types of strings is
      their soft, pleasant sound. The disadvantage is their small volume,
      (易走音?), and their \[short] service life.




      Carole Pegg writes in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians that
      the Mongolian zither the yatga is said to have had strings made from a
      variety of materials including horse hair and animal intestine (also known
      as catgut). It is perfectly possible that Chinese zithers were strung with
      such materials at some point and place in time.

      One questions that comes up from time to time is what thickness of string
      is appropriate for which location on the instrument. This is especially
      important when people are trying to replace a broken string on an older
      guzheng with drawn wires. There is no universal standard as to what
      thickness of string should be used at which point on an instrument, but
      there are some general trends observable on modern instruments. Below are
      the thicknesses of strings on 8 different guzheng, ranging from steel to
      wound copper to nylon. Guzheng A-D are 21-string guzheng with modern nylon
      strings. The first two are full size, the last two are travel size.The
      remaining Guzheng E-H are drawn-wire guzheng, strung with steel or
      copper-wound steel.




      Notes:




      All measurements were taken in inches. The second chart has the same
      measurements converted to millimeters.



      The 16-string guzheng used far thinner wires than the 18-string.



      The sudden jumps in thickness around strings 14+ are from the addition of
      copper windings.




      Wire is sold by its "gauge" but there are several competing measurement
      systems. Use this link to convert from diameter to gauge.

  - heading: String Lifespan
    text: >-
      Modern strings last for different lengths of time depending on how much
      they are played, the tension used, and how energetically they are struck.
      The brand Tianyi suggests in their knowledge base that strings will last
      for 2 years if played daily for one hour. Carol Chang suggests that the
      thinner, higher-pitched strings last 6-12 months while the thicker bass
      strings can last more than 2 years. 


      The real deciding factor is your preference for the sound. Over time the
      string materials wear out. The timbre of their sound changes. You'll be
      able to get them to a desired pitch, but the extra qualities that make
      guzheng music so special will alter. If the sound doesn't bother you there
      is no need to change strings. I know guzheng players and teachers who only
      change strings when they break.
  - heading: String Breaking and Care
    text: >-
      Let's get a fear out of the way: yes strings can break but they are
      unlikely to hurt the player or the instrument. The metal wire in the
      center of a string is what fails first. When it fails all of the string’s
      tension is passed to the nylon winding which will stretch suddenly. It may
      startle you but it won't hurt you.


      Tension and striking force are what wear strings out. High tensions wear
      strings out faster. Poor tuning practices are another prime culprit. If,
      when tuning, you change the pitch of the strings drastically without
      lifting the strings off the bridges, the tension cannot equalize across
      the string. It concentrates at the movable bridge and can snap. Some,
      especially the treble strings, are easy to break when tuning.


      To avoid these issues, follow the guidelines for tuning and check the
      charts for bridge placement for each key. If your bridges are close to
      those locations and you are using the correct string for each space on the
      guzheng, your strings won't be too tight. If your bridges are way far to
      the left, towards the tail, that's a sign your tensions are too high.


      The last thing to consider is that every brand and quality level of string
      is different. Each set can have a different timbre and last a different
      length of time. The lifespans given above are benchmarks. Your mileage may
      vary. If multiple strings break while playing and it's been a while since
      you last bought new strings, consider getting some replacements. If the
      strings are new, it's a sign the instrument is at too high of a tension or
      is being mishandled in some way.


      Common Breaks:

      Player’s area: the string just wore out. 


      On a fixed bridge: the tension was too high for the string. Maybe it was a
      flawed string, maybe the string snagged on the fixed bridge, or maybe the
      movable bridge is too far to the left.


      On a movable bridge: High tension, likely caused by poor tuning habits.
