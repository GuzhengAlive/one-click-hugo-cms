      Oh boy is this complicated. There are between 2 and 15 schools depending
      on how you count. Usually 5 or 6 schools are named, so how do we get to
      15? Read on to learn more! (Visit the Schools and Styles page to learn
      about the characteristics of each school.) . For now, let’s start at the
      beginning.
  - heading: 'First: What is a School?'
    text: >-
      The relevant Mandarin word is liúpài (流派). Liúpài is a concept of
      classification reserved for higher art forms. A “school” as we translate
      to English captures the idea of a style that is passed down from one
      artist to the next, something that goes beyond genre or type. Let’s use
      painting as an example. A painter could create a still life in romantic
      style or in an abstract style. These are very different styles but are of
      the same “genre” of painting - a still life. So too is it with zheng
      music. Two songs can both be focused on telling an important story, but be
      played with different styles. The differences, the nuances, are what were
      taught and passed down within a particular guzheng “school”.




      Guzheng music was not considered high art until the 1950s or 60s so there
      were no nationally recognized liúpài until then. People have had to create
      liúpài very recently- and since guzheng music has exploded in diversity
      and blending in those same 60 or so years, boy has it been hard to agree
      on what constitutes a “school”.




      The most popular naming convention is the geographical region the music
      can be traced back to. The earliest known mention of zheng liúpài came in
      1936 when a musician labeled their record as běipài or northern style
      (北派). (Han 2013) Soon there was a southern style (nánpài 南派). Musicians in
      the north and south offered even more specific names based on things like
      the techniques players used. Schools started to get named after provinces,
      schools, and ethnic groups. 




      When you add all of the names together we get: 




      * 8 major regional schools, 

      * 2 major foreign schools, 

      * 11 almost-synonyms that are roughly equivalent with the first 10
      schools, 

      * 3 true synonyms, 

      * 3 problematic terms,

      * and 5 contentious/defunct schools.




      Here are three diagrams that show how all these relate to each other. The
      first shows the schools that fall roughly in the “North” category. The
      second shows “South” and the third show other names you might encounter as
      you search.

      (Hangzhou). Color indicates the most common name. Size is approximate
      popularity. White boxes are either outdated or part of the larger terms.

      Other Guzheng Schools. These less notable schools may appear in literature
      but aren’t currently considered different enough to warrant naming a
      school for them. Color indicates the most common name. White boxes are
      either outdated or part of the larger terms.

      In anglicized alphabetical order the names and synonyms for the guzheng
      liúpài or schools are:




      1. Cantonese - A regional/cultural descriptor. Includes music attributed
      to the larger province, Guǎngdōng (广东 Also known as Canton), and the major
      city, Guǎngzhōu (广州).

      2. Cháozhōu (潮州) - Another city in Guangdong. Regarded as a separate and
      more storied guzheng tradition than Cantonese zheng.

      3. Fújiàn (福建) - Province in southern China. Includes music attributed to
      its southern region, Mǐnnán (闽南); might also be used to include music
      influenced by the Mǐn (闽) people.

      4. Hakka (客家, Mandarin: kèjiā) - Ethnic group and descriptor for their
      culture. Other associated terms are hàndiào (漢調, Tunes of the Han),
      zhōngzhōu gǔdiào (中州古調, Ancient Tunes of the Central Plain), wàijiāng xián
      (外江弦, Strings of Foreign Rivers) and Guǎngdōng hànyue (广东汉乐, Cantonese Han
      Music). You may see the Chinese romanization, Kejia in some non-Chinese
      sources. “Hakka” is closer to how those characters are pronounced in this
      people’s dialect; kèjiā is the Mandarin pronunciation.

      5. Hénán (河南)  - Province in Northern China.

      6. Shǎanxī (陕西) - Province in central China considered Northern. Music
      from this area can also be labeled as Qín (秦) in reference to the Qin
      people/dynasty that used to be there.

      7. Shāndōng (山東) - Province in Central China considered Northern.

      8. Zhèjiāng (浙江) Province in central China considered Southern. Also known
      as Wǔlín (武林). Includes songs attributed to its capital city, Hángzhōu
      (杭州).

      These contain music attributed to the two major influential foreign
      traditions - Korean and Mongolian.




      1. Korean (朝鲜, Cháoxiǎn or 韩国 Hángúo) - Coming from Korean culture;
      includes music from the Korean ethnicity that lives in China on the border
      with Korea. It also is used to name music composed for the Korean long
      zither the Gayaguem (伽倻琴, jiāyē qín).

      2. Mongolian (蒙古国, Ménggǔ guó) - Coming from Mongolian Culture; includes
      music from the Mongolian ethnicity from Inner Mongolia (内蒙古, Nèiménggǔ)
      which is a northern region of China, or music adapted from the Mongolian
      long zither “yatga” (雅托葛, Yǎtuōgé). 


      That gives us the 10 so far - 8 Chinese schools, 1 Mongol, 1 Korean. But
      you’ll encounter a few more names if you go searching. First and foremost
      are the minor or defunct schools, categories that haven’t gotten off the
      ground.
  - heading: Five Minor Schools
    text: >-
      Thee five schools have been proposed or intentionally founded in the last
      50 years, but haven’t been widely accepted. The main objections are that
      their repertoires are too small, their differences are not distinct from
      their neighbors, and too few people play in each style.




      1. Fùgǔ (復古) translated as Renaissance, this movement was led by two
      experts, Wei Ziyou and Shi Yinmei with a focus on reviving old zheng
      pieces. (Han 2000)

      2. Hong Kong (香港, xiānggǎng) referring to Hong Kong in southern China.
      Guzheng music only started to become popular in the city in the 1970s or
      80s. Guzheng music in Hong Kong is largely songs from other schools and
      does not have its own unique style - yet. One guzheng expert So Chun-bo
      devoted the later part of his life to establishing a Hong Kong style; his
      efforts may yet bear fruit.

      3. Liáoníng (sometimes represented as Liaolin) 辽宁 - a Northern province
      bordering Korea. There just doesn’t seem to be enough repertoire
      attributed to it at present. Perhaps it all get’s wrapped in under the
      label of “Korean”.

      4. Wéixīn 维新 translated as Renovation, this was an effort by zheng expert
      Liang Tsai-ping to both adapt old zheng pieces into a modern style and to
      compose new songs. (Han 2000)

      5. Yúnnán 云南 - A Southern province west of Hong Kong. I have not been able
      to find enough repertoire, activity, or mention of it in my searches.




      That brings us to 15. Last up are three terms that are hard to include as
      true synonyms.
  - heading: Three Problem Terms
    text: >-
      These three words aren’t as clearly defined or widely used. They appear
      just to be synonyms, but each is complicated.




      1. Zhongzhou (中州) is described in different contexts as equivalent to
      either Hakka (Han 2013) or Henan (Cheng 1991 and Han 2013). The Hakka were
      in Henan 1200 years ago but left and brought their culture south.
      Shongzhou translates as “Central Plain”, the physical region of China
      Henan is part of. Maybe the confusion comes from that.  

      2. Hanjiang is said by Cheng 1991 to be an equivalent to Cháozhōu (潮州).
      Hanjiang is either a district in Fujian province or relates to the Han
      River which runs partly through Shaanxi. Both Fujian and Shaanxi already
      have their own recognized musical styles making this label difficult to
      place. Cheng 1991 is the only one of 10 sources who uses this term so I’ve
      left it off the charts.

      3. Dapu is also listed as a synonym by Cheng 1991, this time for Hakka.
      Dapu could be a region or it could be the term for interpreting a musical
      score into a song, a concept from that other Chinese zither the qin. As he
      is the only one of 10 sources who uses it I have left it off the charts.




      And there you go! Some insight into the many names of schools you may
      encounter and how they relate to each other. I am confident this list
      represents the most commonly used categories but the synonyms and minor
      schools get tricky. If you know better please send me an email! Here’s
      where I got my info:
