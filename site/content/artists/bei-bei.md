Originally from Chengdu, Bei Bei has been making waves in California for over a decade. Her latest album is a brilliant mix of genres, and she has this incredible ability to weave her playing in with other instruments. I catch myself wondering where her guzheng playing stops and other instruments being. My favorite factoid: you can hear her perform on the Battlestar Galactica soundtrack, and on Episode "The Eye of Jupiter", I believe.

Bei Bei's recent collaboration with Shawn Lee, Year of the Funky, is an upbeat combination of Chinese and American funk. I adore the rhythmic strikes she uses in the opening. They are so catchy!
