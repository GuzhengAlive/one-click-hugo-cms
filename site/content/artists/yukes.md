Largely self taught, Yukes mixes the guzheng with his own musical sensibilities. He's found its beautiful sounds encourages other to engage, so Yukes regularly invites members of the public to explore the instrument with him. His song Thinkinbout is a great example of stepping outside tradition to express a new perspective. Originally from New York, Yukes splits his time between Los Angeles, New York, and Shanghai.
