Originally from Beijing, currently in Tennessee, Wu Fei grabbed my attention when I saw video of her singing along with her instrument during an interview. The more I learned about her career the more amazed I became. She has collaborated with a  wide variety of musicians across a range of genres, blending her skill with voice and instrument with groups large and small. I highly recommend checking out her work.
