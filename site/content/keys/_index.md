      Guzheng are tuned in Major Pentatonic Keys. The most common are D and G
      but you will encounter others. You change keys by shifting one bridge in
      each octave to the left or right.


      It’s also important to know that the notation on sheet music changes with
      each key.  The number "1" on a guzheng score corresponds to the first
      scale degree or tonic note - the same note the key is named after.

      their notes, and their notation.")


      For example:


      The Key of D has the notes D,E,F#,A,B. The 1st scale degree or tonic note
      is D. So, sheet music is written as 1,2,3,5,6 where D=1. The Key of G
      shifts each F# bridge slightly to the right to become G. You end up with
      the notes D,E,G,A,B, BUT we change the notation to start counting with G
      =1. So on sheet music, 1,2,3,5,6 means G,A,B,D,E.


      Confusing, right? Well, there's one helpful principle: If your
      instrument's bridges are placed correctly you'll notice alternating sets
      of 3 and 2. The left bridge in the set of 3 is always number 1 on sheet
      music. This holds for all of the following 9 keys.

  - heading: Why?
    text: >-
      So why does the notation change with each key? In part that’s because of
      music theory - we number the strings based on their “scale degree”, or
      relative place in a 7-note scale. In practice it helps players know how
      far they need to press strings to get to the next note in the key. By
      shifting which note is “1” we guarantee that the “4” note is always a half
      step above “3” and the “7” note is always a whole step above “6”. The 3
      string only needs to be pressed a little bit to reach the 4 but the 6
      needs a larger press to reach 7. If the notation did not change the player
      could not predict how far to press strings.


      ### Fun note:


      According to Kwok 1987, determining the tuning an instrument is in by
      listening to a song is so difficult as to be impossible. Most songs use a
      combination of open and pressed strings to cover a range of as much as 4
      notes on a single string. A musician could play the same set of notes on
      several different turnings depending on how much and how many strings they
      pressed.
