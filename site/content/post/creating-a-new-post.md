No image, just text. Something should be created in github under the "post" folder.

Now let's try the inbuilt imager for images and text. Oky but where does more text go?

![Alt Text](/img/tomb-306-musicians-smithsonian.png "Title")

I guess I can switch to markdown and make it work.
Hurrah?

Heay there we go.
