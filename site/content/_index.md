      The gǔzhēng (古筝) is a shockingly beautiful long zither from China. The
      name is Mandarin Chinese for "ancient zither". "Gu" is pronounced close to
      "goo" and "zheng" similar to "jung".




      Get up to speed with a 90-second summary. Relax with some excellent
      guzheng music. Explore the many related instruments, like the Japanese
      Koto, Korean Gayageum, and Mongolian Yatga.  If you’re ready for a long
      read, dive into the deep history of the guzheng. Explore to your heart’s
      content!




      So many parts come together to create this wondrous fusion of new and old.
      Performers sit by the rectangular head of the instrument and pluck the
      strings in front of them. By pressing and vibrating the strings to the
      left of the movable bridges, that array of supports that curve down the
      center of the instrument, the player can change the pitch with subtleties
      rarely found in the repertoire of the West.

      > _"The guzheng sings to my soul. Layers of art move through and across.
      No lines are parallel. The soundboards curve in two directions, the
      strings lift up in a sweeping array of lines, and even the underside is
      curved upwards.   Every note provides an anchor from which to explore."_
