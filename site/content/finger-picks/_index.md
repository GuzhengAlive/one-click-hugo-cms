      Nails are sold by their size (型号, xínghào). Size depends on the length of
      your middle finger’s pad, measured from the tip to your first knuckle.
      Your goal is to have nails that cover most of your pad and extend 3-5mm
      beyond the tip of your finger.  Sizes are recommended for certain ages or
      certain heights. In general:


      **Small  (小号, xiǎo hào):**


      Who: children below the age of 9 or under 1.3m tall (51 inches, 4’3”)


      Nail Lengths: Finger:22-23mm Thumb: 24-25mm


      **Medium (中号, zhōng hào):**


      Who: adolescents between 10-15 or between 1.3 and 1.6m tall (51-63 inches)


      Nail Lengths: 24-26mm Thumb:27-28mm


      **Large (大号, dà hào):**


      Who: people over the age of 16 or taller than 1.6m (63 inches, 5’3”)


      Nail Lengths: 27-29mm Thumb: 30-31mm




      Thumb nails are measured by the furthest two points on the nail. Two nails
      can have the same thumb length but vastly different reach and design.

      The next big difference between nail sets is the curvature of their
      surfaces.  You will find these and the indent below called out under
      ‘‘规格’’ (guīgé , specification) alongside the indents, below.


      **Flat, beginner nails** - Both sides are flat. These are almost always
      thin and considered insufficient for advanced techniques. Often found
      taped to cards. This is not often labeled, it’s obvious.


      **单弧 (dān hú)** - “Single Arc” - one side is flat while the other is
      curved. The curved surface is what strikes the strings; the flat side is
      what touches the skin. The finger side can be flat or it can be indented.
      These are considered easier to use than Double Arc nails but are not as
      effective at some techniques.


      **双弧 (shuāng hú)** - “Double Arc” - the nails are curved on both sides.
      This nail style is said to provide the best playing experience across all
      techniques but is harder to control. It allows for focused force
      transmission between the string and the finger. Proper taping technique is
      important as these nails are less stable on the finger when taped
      improperly.

      Nails can be shaped to better fit the finger. Each shape comes with
      benefits and costs.


      Flat - Easy to make and cheaper to buy and store, but offer less control.
      They are prone to shifting on  the finger. Flat sides are often found on
      beginner’s nails and 单弧 (dān hú, Single Arc) nails.


      凹槽 (āo cáo) - “Concave Groove”. The string side is convex while the finger
      side has an indent for your finger’s pad. It’s great for beginners because
      it is very stable and comfortable. Some people warn it can cause fingers
      to sweat in the summer.


      双槽 (shuāng cáo) - “Double Groove”  The string side is curved while the
      finer side has two grooves cut in the surface. This is supposed to
      increase stability but varies person to person. Some people may find the
      ridge presses uncomfortably into the finger while it may be just fine for
      others.


      全弧 (quán hú) - “Full Arc” The entire finger side of the nail is concave
      rather than just an indent. This is apparently a newer style for people
      with wider fingers. It’s not pictured as the nail set I have is
      translucent and difficult to photograph.

    heading: Thickness

      Thicker nails are less flexible, emphasize lower pitches, and are less
      prone to breaking. They are however a bit heavier and can be difficult for
      smaller children or those with weaker fingers. Thin nails require less
      strength and emphasize higher frequencies but their flexibility can make
      some techniques difficult.


      Thickness is measured in millimeters and can be anywhere from less than
      1.5mm to more than 3.5mm.  Flat nails tend to be on the thin side while
      tapered nails tend to be thicker. From [one
      recommendation](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/discovery/item/5abbaa3e19f71621b842940a?_at=4094af468c2e9e3c03028a90cb5facedce470):


      Age < 7 years, grades 1-3: 1.5mm


      Grades 4-5: 2.0mm


      Grades 7-10: 2.5mm


      High level students: 2.5mm to 3.0mm


      Beyond 3.0mm: players who specifically need the extra thickness for their
      techniques.


      Note: It is unclear if “grade” refers to guzheng playing ability (1-10) or
      the year of school.

    heading: Angles

      There is one other factor: The angles of the nail. Now, there is no
      standard measuring system that I know of but the end result is the same:
      what angle does the thumb nail make with the rest of the finger? How sharp
      is the angle on the point of the nail? How quickly does the thickness of
      the nail decrease to nothing? There is a general practice but individual
      nails vary. If you find yourself excelling with one set of nails and
      struggling with another, you’re not crazy. Small differences do matter.


      On the thumb angle there is a newer style that is gaining popularity
      called 半月型  (bànyuè xíng ) “Half-moon type”. The thumb is so curved it
      looks like a crescent moon. No word on how that affects playing or their
      sound.
