      I have good and bad news. The good news: getting started with guzheng is
      cheaper than with just about any other instrument out there. The bad news:
      it's still a chunk of money. A new player should expect to spend $700 USD
      on the instrument and related equipment. Lessons add another $1,000-$2,000
      USD per year. That's $1,700-$2,700 for the year or $140 - $225 per month
      for the first year. Equipment costs should almost completely vanish in the
      second year - $50 for replacement tape, picks, and maybe a string or two.




      For context: Beginner guitars and ukuleles are typically cheaper than
      guzheng while violins and cellos are more. Quality beginner violin
      packages cost about $1,200 before lessons. Cello packages can easily cost
      $3,000 before lessons. $700 for a performance-ready guzheng, then, is a
      great deal. If you are really lucky you can get a used instrument for even
      less.




      Let’s get to it! All price estimates are made in August of 2018 for
      players in North America.

      ## New - $500-$20,000


      ![Dunhuang Guzheng](/img/dunhuang-guzheng_compressed.jpg)


      Instruments sold in the United States of America start at about $500 USD.
      Even the lowest-price ones sound great. A reputable model from a reputable
      seller will serve you for years. Do pay attention to shipping costs when
      shopping. Some sellers include shipping in the total price while others
      charge for it separately. Shipping a guzheng in North America is generally
      around $100.  




      It is also possible to have an instrument shipped from Asia but it's
      usually more trouble than it is worth. Entry-level models range from $150
      USD for instruments you will regret buying to $350 for reasonable
      versions. Those numbers may sound lower but shipping makes up the
      difference. An English-Language store in Beijing quotes $205 to ship to
      the USA from China while a store in Singapore quotes $278 USD. Add that to
      the $350 purchase price and you’ve already exceeded $500. Shipping delays,
      customs, and changing import restrictions can add to the headache. It is
      therefore a wiser choice for a beginner to purchase domestically. 




      Mass-market concert-quality guzheng top out at about $5,000. Beyond that
      you enter the realm of specialty and master-craftsman instruments. The top
      price for these tends to be about $20,000. For example, the wonderful
      HKZhengArt currently has a Dunhuang for $18,000 USD while
      ChineseZither.net has a Mitsuya Koto quoted at $16,800. One-of-a-kind
      instruments can retail for more but the price has little to do with the
      sound quality. The most expensive guzheng I have ever seen was accented
      with gold and jade and sold for ~$128,000 at the Music China 2018
      tradeshow. You can always find something more expensive if you know where
      to look.




      But back to students: $1000 is higher than any new student should pay.
      Anything above $1,000 is a jaw-dropping luxury. It's the equivalent of
      getting a convertible for a student driver. Great if you can afford it but
      entirely unnecessary. I know musicians who have performed for decades on
      mid-level instruments. Any quality guzheng, even entry-level instruments
      in the $500 range will provide personal enjoyment for decades as long as
      they are cared for properly.  $800 instruments will wow and amaze. 




      If you do wish to purchase something more expensive, please do! They are
      works of art that are meant to be shared and enjoyed. Just make sure you
      are buying them because you want to, not because you feel you have to in
      order to play well.


      ## Used - $200-$800


      Finding a guzheng on the used market in North America is all about
      location and luck. Major websites such as eBay, Craigslist, and Kijiji
      average 2-3 used guzheng a month, country-wide. Facebook Marketplace seems
      to have more, with 5 active the day of this writing (NY, CA, DE, WA). Many
      are priced close to what you would pay for a new instrument so weigh
      potential savings against the risks of buying used. Guzheng are more
      commonly found for sale on the coasts but a few pop up every year in the
      interiors. It is possible to find a damaged but playable instrument for
      around $200 if you are patient. Increase your budget to $400 -$500 and
      you'll have better luck.




      $350, $450, and $800 USD are common prices for instruments.  Use our Buy
      Used guide to help negotiate price. Read listings carefully and discuss
      price with the seller. I've seen factory-fresh instruments listed as
      '"antique" and 25-year-old war horses with obvious body damage listed as
      "like new".




      I put the top of the used range at $800 because I do not recommend buying
      a used instrument for more if it is your first. $800 can get you a very
      nice new instrument from a quality brand without the risks of hidden
      problems - or the risk of getting fooled into paying more than an
      instrument is worth. High-end instruments do occasionally come up for sale
      but they are rare. I’ve seen 4 high quality guzheng for sale in the last
      18 months (Feb 2019). Everything else priced above $800 was, by my
      estimate, over priced.




      Buying used can save you money and is great for the community and the
      environment, but remember that students need support. Support can come
      from members of the community or through the staff of a quality store. If
      you have contacts in the guzheng community then buying used is wonderful.
      If you don’t know anyone, buying from a store means you can go to them for
      help.




      ## Rentals - ~$600/year


      Rentals are a great way to check a student's interests. Rent a guzheng for
      a few months and if you or your child are still interested, go ahead and
      buy one. From what I've seen stores and some teachers ask about $50 USD
      per month. Rent for a year and you'll spend as much as it would cost to
      buy your own. I like to think of it this way: if you commit to play the
      instrument for one year, you've given yourself a budget of $600. Buy an
      instrument for that much. At the end of the year you can keep playing for
      free or resell it to get a little money back and pass the joy on to
      someone else.

    text: >-
      1st year cost: $0-$12


      ![Guzheng Nails](/img/img_20181213_161835-1-_compressed.jpg)


      Nails, picks, or plectra, as they are called, are the next thing to get
      after purchasing an instrument. Any hard material can be used to make
      nails though different materials provide different sounds. The best nails
      are solid and rigid. The go-to materials used to be plastic, resin, and
      metal. A type of turtle shell came into vogue a few decades ago but
      unsustainable hunting drove the turtles near extinction. It's better for
      the future of guzheng players and for the environment to use other
      materials while the turtle population regrows. Plastics, resins, stone,
      bone, bamboo, and metal are all options. Read more about nail materials
      here.




      Nails range from less than $0.75 USD per nail to $5.00 or more. That is a
      range of $6-40 USD total for the 8 picks needed to cover both hands.
      Instruments are often sold with a basic set of nails - thin plastic sets
      that are very similar to guitar picks. These are fine for new players and
      can last children for years. In fact, if you ever lose one of these you
      can fashion a replacement out of a guitar pick. 




      Higher quality nails tend to be thicker with more care given to their
      shape. They can include tapered edges, curved surfaces, and sculpted
      indentations for your fingers. Read more about nail shapes here. 




      An intermediate set of thick plastic nails should cost about $12 USD.
  - heading: Tape
    text: >-
      1st year: $12


      ![Guzheng finger tape](/img/guzheng-tapes_compressed.jpg)


      Tape is used to attach the nails to fingers. You'll want a breathable tape
      with an adhesive that doesn't bother your skin. Cloth tapes are common
      though other forms of tape can work. A good place to start is with guzheng
      or pipa tape from an online music store. A single roll should be about
      $1-2 before shipping. Woven First Aid or medical tape from a pharmacy may
      work as well. 




      You'll typically want lengths of 2.5 to 4 inches per finger. Assuming you
      tape four fingers every week, a 5-meter roll of tape will last about 8
      weeks.
  - heading: Strings
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$30


      ![](/img/guzheng-strings_compressed.jpg)


      Strings can last for years. If one happens to break you can order a
      replacement for $1.50-$3 USD. Complete sets range from $30-$70. String
      quality has a large impact on instrument sound so buy the best strings you
      can afford. Most new instruments come with several replacement strings as
      part of their purchase price. 




      Purchase "Type B" strings. They are an improvement over the older standard
      string, Type A. Most modern instruments are built for Type B strings and
      the higher tension they require. “Type C” strings are used for diatonic
      tunings which beginners don't need to worry about.
  - heading: Stands
    text: >-
      1st year: $0 (or $30 or $60)


      ![Guzheng Stands](/img/folding-guzheng-stands_compressed.jpg)


      Stands are typically included with instruments both new and old. If you do
      need a set you can expect to pay $60 for a two-piece set like those
      pictured or $100 or more for a 3-piece stand. Two piece stands are folding
      legs that support each end of the instrument. 3-piece stands are made of
      two vertical supports that are held in place by a crosspiece. 2-piece
      stands are more portable, while 3-piece stands are more stable and look
      fancier. Guzheng stands usually position the head of the instrument higher
      than the tail, encouraging better posture for left-hand techniques.




      An alternative to purpose built guzheng stands are keyboard stands.
      X-brace keyboard stands sell for $30-$60 USD and are more adjustable and
      easier to find than guzheng stands. They can be adjusted to fit your
      personal height preference, especially valuable if you have long legs.
      Just make sure the stand you want to purchase can support your instrument
      in the right places at the right height. Be mindful of the stand’s
      stability. 




      X-brace stands are often used to allow a performer to play while standing
      up, but this can place the supports too close to the center of the
      instrument, making it wobble during play. Other types of keyboard stands
      can be used in the place of guzheng stands. Just make sure they are the
      right height, width, and depth for your instrument. You may need to add
      felt or cloth rests to protect the bottom of your guzheng.
  - heading: Seat
    text: >-
      1st year: $0




      Special stools can be purchased but they aren't needed. Most players use
      whatever chair is available. Use one from around your house or go to a
      second-hand store to find a chair or stool you like sitting on. The most
      important thing is to make sure you sit in an ergonomic position with
      proper posture when you play. The chair should be high enough that your
      feet are flat on the floor and your thigh bones are parallel to the ground
      or sloping slightly downward towards your knees. Padded seats can make
      longer practice sessions far more enjoyable.
  - heading: Tuner
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$20


      ![Guzheng Tuners](/img/guzheng-tuners_compressed.jpg)


      Simple tuners are often included in new instrument purchases. They can
      also be purchased separately. Any guitar tuner that can distinguish
      between natural and sharp notes will work. There are also a variety of
      free tuning apps available for smartphones. Specialty guzheng tuners can
      be purchased for $5-$20 USD.
  - heading: Case
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$60.


      ![Guzheng Case](/img/green-guzheng-case_compressed.jpg)


      Most new instruments come with a soft case. If yours didn't, buy one.
      Cases protect your guzheng and make it easy to carry. Soft cases are
      essentially fabric and won't offer much protection from collisions but
      will keep out dust. They range from $50-$70 and can be made waterproof.
      Hard cases offer full protection but can be heavier and larger than the
      instrument. Hard cases are difficult to find in North America. I know of
      only two retailers that have hard cases for sale: a full-weight case for
      $500 and a fiberglass case for $700.




      As of May 2019:  I’ve also seen cases for sale from shippers in China.
      English-language Alibaba has a fiberglass case for $350 (including
      shipping) and AliExpress has a standard hard case for $250 (including
      shipping). Chinese language site Tmall had a standard case for $170
      including shipping “overseas” and fiberglass cases for $300-400, shipping
      not included.




      I know this is as much as a beginner’s instrument. If you don’t expect to
      travel much a soft case will be fine. If you are traveling you should
      invest in a padded hard case.
  - heading: Humidity Control
    text: >-
      1st year: $60 plus cost of water and electricity




      When the cold weather comes you will need a humidifier to keep your
      guzheng from cracking and a hygrometer to measure the humidity in the air.
      You can read more in the Care and Maintenance page. Budget around $60 USD
      for a humidifier and hygrometer.
  - heading: Learning Materials
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$40




      There are many options available to you. There are video lessons and
      training materials available online in English for free. The
      Chinese-language guzheng websites have loads more. 




      A book of lessons will typically cost you from $5-$20 USD. Any given book
      could give you enough for several months to several years depending on how
      quickly you work through it and how much the book has. Some teachers ask
      you to purchase a book to learn alongside lessons while others may provide
      the learning materials for free. Every person’s final cost will vary.
  - heading: Lessons
    text: >-
      1st year: $1500-$2500




      Learning with an actual teacher provides more information and yields
      better outcomes than self-learning alone. Self learning is great! But a
      single lesson with a teacher can be worth several hours of personal trial
      and error. It can also prevent you from developing posture and technique
      problems that you have to overcome later. That said, lessons are the
      largest cost of playing the guzheng. Your best bet is to find the balance
      of lessons and self-learning that work for you.




      The estimate that a year of lessons costs $1500-$2500 assumes a weekly
      lesson of between $30 and $50 per week for 48 weeks. That leaves 4 weeks
      left over for vacations, busy schedules, and the like. To spread your
      budget you could take lessons every two weeks and fill in the time with
      extra practice and self study. You can also look for group lesson
      discounts to defer the cost among several students. An increasing number
      of teachers are offering video lessons as well - perhaps you could work
      out a mix of in-person lessons and video checkups. Discuss your particular
      balance with your teacher. In my estimate at the top of the page I drop
      the numbers to $1,000-$2,000 as most students go less than 48 times per
      year. (Summer trips, school conflicts, etc.)




      And there you have it! If you have any questions about these numbers or
      any of the topics mentioned feel free to send an email below.
