      Guzheng music is written in cypher notation. Learn how to read it and
      you’ll learn how to read guzheng sheet music.




      First a bit of history: Guzheng music used to be passed down by ear.
      Teachers would have their students listen to the teacher's rendition, sing
      the song, and then play it themselves. Songs were not codified
      instructions, they were templates. Each player would play it a little
      differently so there was no need to record every specific detail. Then the
      20th century happened.




      Musical reforms in the mid 20th century were heavily influenced by the
      idea that the music and instruments of China needed to compete with the
      music and instruments of Europe. This led to the formation of specialty
      schools and a desire for standardization. 




      Nowadays guzheng music is written in two systems: the western staff
      notation and the Chinese jiǎnpǔ (简谱). We know 简谱 in English as Cypher
      Notation, Cipher Notation, Numeric Notation, or Numbered Musical Notation.

      Jiǎnpǔ (简谱) or Cypher Notation represents notes with numbers. The duration
      of notes is indicated by lines and dots around each number. Further marks
      are added around each note to tell the player which technique to use and
      which ornamentations to add.

      ![Numeric Notation Scale](/img/notation-scale.png "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La,
      Ti, and rest in Cypher Notation.")


      Numeric or Cypher notation gets its name from the use of numbers to
      represent notes. Each number represents a note in a key. Unlike staff
      notation, an individual number could represent any pitch. The player needs
      to know the key the music is in to identify which note, which pitch, is
      represented by which number. 




      Guzheng music in cypher notation is usually written on a Movable Do scale.
      This means that while "1" is always referred to as Do the pitch of the
      note depends on the key the song is in. 1 will be the same note as the
      name of the key. Songs in the key of D use 1 to represent D. Songs in the
      key of G use 1 to represent G and so on. Pitch increases with number. A 6
      is a higher pitch than a 1.




      Any number 8 or higher is referring to the physical string on the
      instrument, not a note. A 0 indicates a rest. If you see letters in place
      of numbers you have stumbled onto koto notation.




      Guzheng are typically tuned so that unmodified or "open" strings produce
      notes on a pentatonic scale. For that reason the five open strings of an
      octave are notated as 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. A 4 is played by pressing a 3
      string with the left hand to raise the string's pitch by a half step. A 7
      is played by pressing a 6.

      ![Cipher Notation Octave markers](/img/cypher-notation-octaves.png
      "Indicating octaves in Cypher Notation.")


      A typical guzheng is tuned to include notes in 5 octaves. Octaves are
      distinguished by placing dots above or below a note. A number without a
      dot is a note in the home octave, the octave that is physically the most
      comfortable to play. The home octave changes for every key. In the Key of
      D the home octave is strings 11, 10, 9, 8, and 7.  In the Key of G the
      home octave is strings 9, 8, 7, 6, and 5.




      Going back to the Key of D the lowest string on the guzheng, string 21, is
      marked as 1 with two dots below it - the second note in the image above.
      The highest note on the same instrument is 1 with two dots above it - the
      sixth note in the image above. Since guzheng music is usually notated with
      Movable Do the highest and lowest notes of an instrument and their
      notation change depending on the tuning. In the key of G, for example,
      notes range from a high of 5 with one dot above it to a low of 5 with
      three dots below.
  - heading: Duration

      ![Cipher Notation Duration 1](/img/duration-cypher-notation-2.png "Cypher
      notation for durations from quarter to thirty second notes.")


      An unmodified note is a quarter note. Adding a line halves the note's
      duration. This is the same as adding flags to notes in staff notation. One
      line indicates an eighth note, two lines indicate a sixteenth, and three
      lines indicate a thirty-second.


      Adding a dot extends the note by half of its duration. This functions the
      same as it does in staff notation. A quarter note with a dot lasts the
      combined length of a quarter and an eighth note. A sixteenth note with a
      dot lasts the combined length of a sixteenth and a thirty second note.


      ![Cipher Notation duration 2](/img/duration-cypher-notation-1.png "Cypher
      notation for whole to half notes.")


      Notes that last longer than a quarter note are indicated by horizontal
      dashes that replace every subsequent note until you reach the desired
      duration. A whole note is indicated by a note followed by three dashes. A
      dotted half note is a note followed by two dashes and a half note is
      indicated by a note followed by one dash. 


      For those familiar with staff notation or western music more broadly you
      may have a sense that something is a little bit strange. Let me help you.
      Think about the guzheng and the piano. An extended note on the piano means
      you are actively touching the instrument, holding down a key. The same
      with bowed instruments like cellos - an extended note means you are
      actively bowing. For the guzheng it is the opposite - every note sounds
      for as long as it wants unless you silence it. Truly resonant instruments
      can sound notes for 10 seconds or longer. This notation reflects that. The
      note indicates when you touch the instrument while these dashes are
      telling you to wait. That's why there is no need for special notation for
      anything longer than a quarter note. Every note is sustained by default.


      Some techniques act as exceptions to this rule; see the Finger Techniques
      page for more details.

      ![Cypher Notation rests 1](/img/rests-cypher-notation-1.png "Cypher
      notation for rests from one quarter to one thirty second in duration.")


      ![Cypher Notation Rests 2](/img/rests-cypher-notation-2.png "Cypher
      notation for whole and half rests.")


      A rest is represented by a 0. A rest means the instrument is silent. This
      can require the player to manually silence the strings with a finger,
      hand, or both hands. Rest durations are indicated by the same line
      modifiers as regular notes. It is more common to see two rests of
      different durations in sequence than it is to see a dotted rest but both
      can be understood.

      Cypher notation borrows heavily from staff music symbols. Ties, slurs,
      triplets, and various other indicators and articulations are used the same
      way they are in staff notation.

      This deserves its own article! With close to 150 known techniques to
      choose from guzheng scores often include symbols that help the player
      understand how they should be playing particular notes or sections.
