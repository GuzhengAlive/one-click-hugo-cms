      As I visited libraries, scored digital archives, and sought out
      circumstantial references I was disappointed by how rarely the guzheng
      made it into mass-market books. How little you ask? Behold a sampling of
      print and web references! Romanizations are original unless they are
      inside \[square brackets]. This isn't absolutely every mention I've found,
      but these are the most informative.

      education, social life, arts, and history of the Chinese Empire and its
      inhabitants](http://www.archive.org/details/middlekingdomsur02will)",
      Volume 2, Chapter 16, Section on Musical Instruments (Page 100)


      > There are other instruments similar to the \[qin] one with thirty, and
      another with thirteen strings, played with plectrums. \[Likely a reference
      to both the se and an early zheng].


      **1874**: "[Short Notes on Chinese Instruments of
      Music](http://library.uoregon.edu/easia/node/183)", section of a larger
      book, N.B. Denny (Page  112)


      > 筝 written “chang” and called “The small lute”. 'Originally a 12-stringed
      instrument, but, latterly, one kwong-hsin 蒙恬 \[Méngtián] introduced a
      13th. “The upper surface of the chang is round to represent heaven, the
      bottom flat to represent the earth, and the interior is hollow.' The
      instrument is now-a-days much used by blind beggars.


      **1884**: "[China Imperial Maritime Customs II - Special Series No. 6
      Chinese Music](http://www.archive.org/details/chinesemusic00vana)", J.A.
      Van Aalst (page 64)


      > No. 21—The Tseng () is exactly the same as the se in form and principle;
      but it is smaller and has only 14 strings, all elevated on movable
      bridges. It is used in preference to the se at imperial receptions and on
      joyful occasions. The notation is identical with that of the se.

      > \[Note: the character shown next to "Tseng" in the text appears to be a
      squished compound of 糸爭 (Mì zhēng) with mì as the left side of the
      character and zhēng as the right.]


      **1904**: "Things Chinese or Notes connected with China", J Dyer Ball, 4th
      edition (page 411)


      > "Some of the stringed instruments are also more ancient; there are a
      number of lutes \[zithers], guitars, and violins, some of the latter with
      the bow passing between the strings."


      **1908**: "[List of the Musical and Other Sound-Producing Instruments of
      the Chinese](http://library.uoregon.edu/easia/node/389)", A.C. Moule (Page
      111)


      > 3. CHÊNG(1) (TCHENG) 筝. A smaller kind of she \[se]. Engel (p. 182) has
      : "Tche. Wood mounted with bone. Sixteen thin brass wires. L. 3 ft., 2 1/2
      in. W. 8 1/2 in." The Rev. F. W. Galpin has a specimen, purchased perhaps
      at Hongkong, with fourteen brass wires.(2) The instrument shops at
      Hangchow, however, say that it has properly fifteen silk strings. At
      Peking a pair of Chêng has been seen, each 5 or 6 feet long and with
      fourteen silk strings.

      >

      > The Chêng seems to differ from the Shé chiefly in the depth of the body,
      which is 4 or 5 inches for an instrument about 4 feet long. Van Aalst
      says: "\[quotes Van Aalst above, 1884]" The Shuo Wên describes it as a
      stringed instrument with a bamboo body. A note in the music section of the
      Shih Chi also mentions bamboo, but with reference probably to quite a
      different Chêng. Another old book says : 'A sort of Shé, originally with
      twelve strings, but now with thirteen '.-K'ang Hsi. (see Plates X. and
      XI.)

      >

      > (1) This must not be confused with Cheng, the French spelling of Shêng
      (III B.b.2) 1. Chêng often appears as Tseng in European books.

      >

      > (2) Compare also Brussels Catalogue, 150. The instrument there described
      and figured has fourteen brass strings; and also a vibrating wire inside
      it. The small size of this specimen, less than 39 inches long, and the
      shape, which is more like the Ch'in than the Shê, suggest that the wire-
      strung Cheêng is a southern instrument distinct from that found at
      Hangchow or Peking. A similar instrument in the same collection (No. 761)
      is from Tonkin; and five of such instruments (played by women) appear in a
      photograph of an Annamese band. Tsai Yii evidently intended to indicate
      the northern silk-strung instrument by the name Chêng.


      **1958**: "Nagel's Encyclopedia-Guide China" Section on Chinese Art (page
      253)


      > The qin: a seven-stringed lute, and one of the oldest instruments. It
      looks like a flat narrow wooden box, about 4 feet long, covered in black
      lacquer, with seven strings.

      >

      > The se and the zheng: different varieties of the qin. They had different
      numbers of strings from one period to another. The se had from 16 to 50
      strings, and the zheng from 13 to 16. A little bridge under each string
      regulates its pitch. The zheng is popular today.


      **1960**: "A General Handbook of China, Volume 1" by Human Relations Area
      Files, Inc/Yale University, Chapter on Artistic and Intellectual
      Expression, Section II-A-4-C-2, "Plucked Strings" (There are no page
      numbers)


      > \[After 440 words on the qin and 130 words on the se, we get:]

      > Cheng: a small kind of se also tuned to the five-tone scale. It usually
      has about fifteen or sixteen strings.


      **1982**: "The Cambridge Encyclopedia of China", Section on Musical
      Instruments


      > Of the instruments used in Zhou times, the zither qin - originally
      probably five-stringed but later seven-stringed - has become the most
      refined musical instrument of China. The 26-stringed zither se is no
      longer in use, but its smaller version, the 13-stringed zither zheng (an
      ancestor of the Japanese koto) survives and is particularly popular in
      southern and southwestern China. The mouth-organ sheng...\[etc]


      **1999**: "Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its
      History and Culture"


      > A 26-stringed zither-like instrument called a se used in ancient China
      is no longer played. However, a 13-stringed zither called a zheng (cheng)
      is still played in southern and southwestern China. It is the prototype of
      the Japanese musical instrument called the koto, which performs a
      comparable role in Japan to the qin in China. See also LITERATI; WANG WEI.


      This book also contains my favorite type of reference, what I call "The
      researcher's &@#-$@%* it!"

      ## Teases that didn't mention the guzheng, but should have!:


      **1898**: "[Paper on Chinese
      Music](https://archive.org/details/paperonchinesemu00richrich)", Mrs.
      Timothy Richard, (Page 20)


      Shallow overview of music in general; even the qin received barely a
      mention.


      **1913**: "[Some aspects of Chinese Music and Some Thoughts and
      Impressions on Art Principles in
      Music](http://library.uoregon.edu/easia/node/2967)", G.P. Green


      Pages 50-55 touch on the qin and se but don't mention other zithers.
  - heading: On The Web
    text: >-
      I've mentioned elsewhere that the internet is a desert in sore need of an
      English guzheng oasis. What do I mean? For starters, let's look at what
      you get if you type "guzheng" and some generic top level domains:




      guzheng.org: San Francisco Guzheng Music Society




      guzheng.com: redirects to
      http://www.chineseculture.net/guqin/instruments/guzhenglist.html, a
      storefront. They ship out of Canada, I think.




      guzheng.net: empty, parked since 2005.




      Most other combinations are empty (.info, .biz, .international, etc).




      Honorable mention: guzheng.cn - Chinese language only, but goodness is
      there a lot of guzheng going on!




      Now, what would you find if you did a general search on "guzheng"? Here's
      a sample of what I find when searching through Google (though it will be
      changed depending on where you are searching from and your own internet
      history).




      http://www.asza.com/Instruments/izheng.shtml - An online museum hosted by
      ASZA, a music production company whose artists include Mei Han, author of
      the 2013 thesis.




      http://www.easonmusicstore.com/categories/Guzheng/13 - Storefront for
      Eason Music, a company in Singapore. I doubt their claim of being "the
      sole distributor of Shanghai Dunhuang 'Yun' Brand" guzhengs, though
      perhaps they mean in Singapore. They made an informative [video on picks
      and nails](https://youtu.be/qSZyEem6QVI). Other links to their content
      marketing efforts abound.




      http://www.ebay.com/bhp/guzheng - Storefront, browsing ebay listings for
      guzhengs




      http://www.philmultic.com/guzheng/ - Artist's website for Liu Fang.
      Extension of her other site, http://liufangmusic.net/English/




      http://www.soundofasia.com/info.html - Storefront.




      https://www.chinesezither.net Storefront, run by Carol Chang, whom I cited
      for her discussion of wood used in the guzheng




      http://flypaper.soundfly.com/tips/musical-tips/what-the-heck-is-a-guzheng/
      - Enthusiast site with brief introduction to the guzheng




      And after that's it's pretty much sound samples, music videos, more
      storefronts, artists, and the occasional app. With most of these
      informational tidbits just a few paragraphs long, you can see why I was
      hungry for more!
