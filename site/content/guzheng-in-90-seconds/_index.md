      Guzheng is the romanization of 古箏. 古 (gǔ) means old or ancient. 筝 (zhēng)
      refers to a zither-type instrument, something with strings stretched
      between two bridges. The two together, "guzheng", means a zither with
      fixed bridges on both ends and moveable bridges in the center.

      The guzheng traces its roots to China [before the 6th century
      BCE](/guzheng-timelines). The oldest zheng found so far dates to about 598
      BCE. It was found in Guìxī county (贵溪) in Jiāngxī province (江西) in
      Southern China in 1979.

      Scholars debate how guzheng came about. Some say it was based on a zither
      made out of a single board, some say it was based on one made from bamboo,
      and others say it developed independently.

      The typical guzheng you will see is based on a 1965 design patented by the
      Dūnhuáng company (敦煌). It is broad enough for 21 strings and the bridge at
      the tail is in the shape of an “S”. It is the most popular version in part
      because of the elegant utility of its design.

      Guzheng are commonly tuned to the pentatonic scale. The two most common
      keys are The key of D: ABDEF# and the key of G: ABDEG. C and F notes are
      achieved by pressing a B or G(or F#) string when it is struck.

      Most modern guzheng have 21 or more strings but [16 and 18-string guzheng
      are still made](/guzhengs-through-time). 100 years ago instruments with 16
      metal strings were the most popular. Nylon-coated metal strings were
      invented in the 1950s and are the current favorite.

      You can find zithers today with anything from [12-26
      strings](/not-quite-guzheng-varieties). Chinese zithers as a category have
      ranged from 5 to 50 strings and used to be strung with silk.

      Chinese Instruments are classified by the material they were made of. For
      those made of multiple materials the sound-producing material seems to be
      what ruled.  The categories are:

      Silk (絲 sī, simplified: 丝), Bamboo (竹, zhú), Wood (木, mù), Stone (石 shí),
      Metal (金, jīn), Clay (土, tǔ or 匏, páo), and Skin/hide (革, gé).

      The guzheng falls into the silk category because its strings were once
      made of silk. The silk category is further divided into those instruments
      that were plucked, struck, or required a bow. The zithers, the guzheng
      among them, are plucked. An example of a struck instrument is the
      [Yángqín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangqin) (揚琴) which is similar to
      a hammer dulcimer. An example of a bowed instrument is the
      [èrhú](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhu) (二胡).

      A guzheng is considered a heterochord half-tube zither in the chordophone
      category by
      [Hornbostel-Sachs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbostel-Sachs), an
      exhaustive system for classifying instruments.

      A chordophone is any instrument that makes music with strings. A
      heterochord instrument uses one material for the soundboard and a
      different material for the strings.  A zither is an instrument with
      strings stretched between two points. A half-tube zither has a soundboard
      that is curved. Put all that together and you get: heterochord half-tube
      zither, a type of chordophone.

      There are zithers all around the world. The piano is a zither! It's a
      "True Board Zither with Resonator Box".

      The historic name for this type of instrument is “zheng”. Various variants
      have been made and named around Asia. These are often labeled
      “(word)-zheng”. Examples: Butterfly Zheng, Multitonic Zheng, Centipede
      Zheng. Think of these like guitars: Acoustic guitar, Classical guitar.
      Electric guitar. The phrase you see nowadays, “Guzheng” is a bit of a
      branding effort by the powers that be. It was felt that adding the
      character for ancient or old to the name gave it more prestige. Yet… the
      designs were updated significantly just 60 years ago. The instrument is
      ancient but it is also modern.

    heading: Common Confusions
    text: >-
      Try not to make these mistakes when describing the guzheng to others. I'm
      ashamed to say I've already made all of them. Please be better than me!


      1) The guzheng if often described by westerners as a Chinese harp. There
      already is a Chinese harp: the
      [Kōnghóu](https://www.facebook.com/whc2017/posts/1848578852022441)! It's
      better to call a guzheng a Chinese zither. A harp has a soundboard or
      resonating chamber that is perpendicular to the strings, while a zither
      has a soundboard that is parallel to its strings.


      2) The instrument is not gender-restricted. Both men and women have played
      and mastered it for centuries. Gender confusions go both ways; in modern
      times it is easy to assume the instrument is for women as they are most
      commonly featured in photos. Yet  at one point in the early 1900s some in
      China said the instrument was for men only. Let’s not be silly. It’s for
      everyone.


      3) The guzheng is not "The Piano of China" nor is it "The most popular
      instrument in China". That's a lazy comparison. A, the piano is the piano
      of China; it was firmly entrenched prior to the popularity of the modern
      zheng. B, how do you even determine popularity? The qin was more prevalent
      and had a higher status for centuries prior, the pipa and erhu were and
      have been everywhere in their own right, and most every western orchestral
      instrument has a large group of players in China. You can say instead that
      the guzheng is massively popular. Estimates of the number of living people
      who actively play the guzheng or have taken lessons range from 20-50
      Million. That is bigger than the population of some countries... but
      remember that China's cities hold about [800 Million
      people](https://www.statista.com/statistics/278566/urban-and-rural-population-of-china/).
      Anyways, determining popularity by a count of who has or could once play
      an instrument would force us to proclaim that [the recorder is the most
      popular instrument in
      America](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/why-every-kid-in-america-learns-to-play-the-recorder).
      It's better to steer clear of that absolute.


      4) Guzheng music is not "Asian" music. "Asia" is a region of 4.4 BILLION
      people. If you ever say "All Asian people \_\_\_\__" you're wrong. If you
      say "Asian Music" you're tying all people in Asia to this one particular
      instrument. The uncountable cultures and variations that make up the 40+
      countries of Asia are worth recognizing. Even in China there are so many
      different cultures it's unfair to say the guzheng or its music represents
      them all.

      Avoid this misstep by being specific. Avoid sweeping statements about
      "Traditional Chinese" or "Chinese Folk" music. Specify that you are
      talking about just one instrument that existed alongside many, many
      others. Use the instrument's name, talk about Guzheng Music, but don't
      lump everything in Asia or even in China all together.

      To put it another way, does the violin represent every aspect of European
      music? Of course not. What about the woodwinds, the percussion, or the
      horns? No, the violin is part of a much larger picture just like the
      guzheng.
