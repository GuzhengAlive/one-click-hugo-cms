      The Guzheng has changed a great deal over the years. This timeline can
      help you understand how those changes took place. Each time period tries
      to have a representation of the zheng that was common during that time
      period. The instruments shown should not be taken as the only type of
      zheng that was in use during that time. Instruments based on earlier
      designs were likely still in use in different regions, and there may have
      been additional designs not captured here. If you know of any, get in

      Zheng types differentiate widely. Labels are added such as wo zheng, zou
      zheng, and tan zheng. Other instruments we today would not consider zheng
      are are included under the label, such as ya zheng and tuosou zheng. Every
      region has its own relationship to and version of the zheng. See Cheng
      1991 page 5 for full description.  Emperor Xuánzōng (唐玄宗) (reign: 713-756
      CE) creates a musical school and titles the best musicians "plucking
      masters", elevating the social standing of musicians in general.  The
      13-string zheng is introduced to Japan where it became known as the koto.

The 13-string was popular in the north while the 15-string was popular in the south. A 16-string variant with copper strings became popular in coastal areas in both the north and south such as modern day Guangdong, the province around Hong Kong, and Shanghai.  Physical styles ranged from the Tang-inspired instruments passed down from the Ming Dynasty to Song-inspired shorter zhengs, which were quite popular. '

      This instrument bears a striking resemblance to the present day Vietnamese
      Đàn tranh. The soundboard is far more curved, suggesting it developed from
      a tubular bamboo-based instrument, rather than a wooden plank-based
      instrument.

      So that brings us to the 20th century. A lot has happened and we have
      better records so get ready for the deluge.




      In the 1900s 23 years of sustained war broke out in China. Civil war took
      place in two pieces from 1927-1937 and from 1946-1950. An invasion from
      Japan occurred in the middle alongside Japan’s other actions in World War
      2. One key issue of these conflicts became China's identity. The side in
      power in 1950 decided China's identity had been damaged by the upper
      classes and had to be repaired by the lower classes. Items seen as upper
      class were seized and destroyed. The owners were publicly humiliated,
      exiled to years of hard labor, or worse. The smaller, more popular qin
      zither was one such symbol and was a target. The zheng was seen as a folk
      instrument, or an instrument of the lower classes, and was therefore saved
      from most persecution. (3)




      Once active hostilities wore down music became seen as key tool for
      unifying the country. Zheng-related events moved quickly in part because
      of government initiatives. Here's a breakdown of those events as reported
      by Dr. Han, Dr. Cheng, Gaywood, and Chinese News Analysis:

      Liang Tsai-Ping (Liáng Zài Píng) (梁在平), a guzheng performer, produces
      Zheng Manual (筝谱, Zhēng Pǔ), the first formally published book that
      discussed and described guzheng technique and music. Another leading man
      in the zheng world, Cáo Zhèng  (曹正), produced his instructional book later
      that same year. His is titled Guzheng Manual (古筝谱, Gǔzhēng Pǔ). (4)(5)

      The Chairman of the Chinese government urges the people to "create new
      through old". The music schools and government react by formalizing zheng
      classes in the conservatories. Their stated goal is to create a new form
      of music using old instruments.
    year: '1951'
  - description: >-
      The first Forum on Instrument Reforms is held in Beijing. Participants
      announce how folk instruments will be standardized and improved. 16-string
      zheng, the most common at the time, are determined to have too small a
      range to accompany large orchestras. It is announced they need to be
      changed.

      Wèi Zhònglè, (衛仲樂, simp: 卫仲乐), a Shanghai-area musician well known for
      performing 'serious' music with traditional Chinese instruments, speaks at
      the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC,
      中国人民政治协商会议), saying that while it was true the Central conservatory had
      established a 'Chinese Folklore Music Department' it was a miserable
      enterprise with few teachers and very few students. In other words, 5 year
      on, the classes created in 1951 weren't getting anywhere. (_Chinese News

      Shanghai Conservatory of Music Wáng Xùnzhī, (王巽之) invent a new form of
      string. Instead of silk or bare metal wire, they create a string with a
      metal core, a silk coating, and a nylon winding. Compared to the old
      strings their new string is stronger, louder, and less prone to changing
      its tone over time.  (cited by Dr. Han from personal correspondence)

      The Chinese government institutes "Nationalization" (民族化, Mínzú huà), a
      series of reforms that included directing players of western instruments
      to learn traditional Chinese instruments instead, possibly in response to
      the lack of success with the previous music programs (see 1951, 1956).

      Xú Zhèngāo (徐振高) of the Shanghai Musical Instrument Factory and Wáng
      Xùnzhī, the zheng instructor at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music add a
      curving "S" bridge to the tail of a 21-string zheng. The tuning pegs are
      changed from exposed wooden pegs on the top of the instrument to metal
      pegs hidden inside the instrument.

      Zhāng Kūn (张昆), a zheng maker at the Shenyang Musical Instrument Factory,
      created the first functional modulated of Key-Changeable zheng. Mechanisms
      near the head of the instrument, by the player's right hand, could change
      the tension of strings. The action also changed other aspects of the sound
      but not in a good way. The issues could not be overcome and the instrument
      was never mass produced. 




      Modulated zhengs received 20+ years of separate development; head over to
      the Guzheng Types page to read about their advancement.

      Wáng Chāngyuán (王昌元) plays her solo piece Battling the Typhoon (戰台風, zhàn
      táifēng) as part of a larger concert for the wife of the Chinese Leader
      Chairman Mao, Jiāng Qīng (江青).  Jiāng Qīng subsequently declares "Battling
      the Typhoon" worth promoting and does so. (Dr. Han p159)




      "Battling the Typhoon" was scored and rescored for multiple instruments
      and became one of the most played and consulted pieces of music during
      that time.




      In my current understanding, "Battling the Typhoon" marked the turning
      point for the guzheng, sending it off on its own vector. Before this point
      the guzheng was just another instrument from the past pushed as part of a
      larger program. Once Wáng Chāngyuán showed it could stand on its own
      promotion and usage increased. BUT! I'm sure there is more to the story.
      What do you know of its rise in popularity? What happened between then and
      now to make the guzheng as big as it is?




      Changes continued after Wáng Chāngyuán's performance that brought the
      guzheng into its current status today. Innovations continued to take
      shape:

      The nylon-wrapped metal string, also named Dunhuang, was officially
      designated as the standard string for guzheng. Nylon-wound strings are now
      the most common.
    year: '1975'
  - description: >-
      The original Dunhuang string is reclassified as "Type A" and a new
      standardized "Type B" string is announced to allow for higher string
      tensions and finer pitch control.
    year: '1997'
  - description: >-
      "Type C" strings are standardized. These sets are capable of even higher
      tensions and are balanced for tuning a 21-string guzheng to the diatonic
      scale rather than the pentatonic scale. Type C strings require extra care,
      so all you pentatonic guzheng enthusiasts, don't just go switching out the
      strings! As your teacher or local store owner for guidance.

      The Pre-Modern timeline is mainly from Cheng 1991 with small additions
      from other sources. The Modern timeline comes from events described in Han
      2013. Cheng has many sources but they are almost exclusively in Chinese,
      limiting my ability to provide context. I've kept all his mentioned
      variants of zhengs in. I have also taken his method of dating events to be
      both indicators of time and of region as dynasties denote both years and
      border changes. To help your mental map I've labeled locations "North" if
      most of their territory sat above modern Hangzhou, approximately north of
      30°31'N, and South if the bulk was below. East/West/Central refer to
      relative location within the borders of modern-day China.

      (3): Chinese history is complex. In depth discussion is, unfortunately,
      far outside the scope of a website about a musical instrument. For those
      interested in learning more, please consider Lazlo Montgomery's [China
      History Podcast](http://teacup.media/the-china-history-podcast/). [The
      civil war is covered in 4 parts in episodes
      119-122](http://teacup.media/?s=civil+war).




      (4): Liang Tsai-Ping previously wrote an earlier work titled "Proposed
      Zheng Manual" (拟筝谱, Nǐ Zhēng Pǔ) in 1938. Depending on definitions that
      could be considered the earliest produced instructional guide, but I am
      under the impression it  did not get a wide release. Also,  Dr. Han lists
      Cao Zheng's work as being "unpublished" but available in the Library of
      the Chinese National Academy of the Arts; Dr. Te-yuan Cheng makes no
      distinction.




      (5): It's important to note that the character "谱" (pǔ) translated here as
      "Manual" also means "guidebook", "reference", or can be shorthand for
      "musical score". Both Liang Tsai-Ping and Cao Zheng's books were all of
      these, from what I understand. I have yet to see a copy myself.




      (6): The Luxun Academy of Arts was founded in 1938 by Chinese leaders in
