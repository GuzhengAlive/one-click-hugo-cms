      Below is a glossary of guzheng-related terminology, names, and locations
      taken directly from the theses of doctors [Mei
      Han](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0073945)
      and [Daphne Shui Hui Kao](http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11860/). Both are
      publicly available at the preceding links. GZA’s contribution is in adding
      pinyin, digitizing the characters (Kao 2003’s characters were handwritten;
      Han 2013’s could not be copied from the text) and providing both
      simplified and traditional versions.




      Most of the original entries follow the Pinyin romanization. Those that do
      not were romanized before Pinyin or have been romanized from non-Mandarin
      sources. Every entry was triple checked for accuracy but if you catch an
      issue send an email through the form below.
