  This is a great introduction to the traditional guzheng repertoire by a modern
  performer recorded with modern equipment. London-based Wu Mengmeng performs 12
  songs from across the traditional guzheng repertoire. These are clean
  recordings of well-performed songs that you may well play yourself.




  Produced by world music publisher ARC Music in London, The Art of the Chinese
  Guzheng is their 15-year follow-on to their 2004 The Art of the Chinese Harp.
  That 2004 album (available on most streaming services and YouTube) was
  performed by Xiao Ying and featured 13 similar but completely different songs
  from across the traditional repertoire.




  Genre: Traditional




  Instruments: Guzheng
