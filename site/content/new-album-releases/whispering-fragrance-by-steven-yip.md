  Whispering Fragrance is a 67-minute long collection of 6 works composed by
  Hong Kong / USA-based Stephen Yip. The guzheng features in mainly just the
  first track “Ding”. To my untrained ear this album would be considered
  “Experimental”. The focus is not on melody or flow as much as it is on
  interesting bursts of sound. You can listen to samples on the album’s webpage.




  The guzheng player is Yu-Chen Wang, a graduate of Tainan National University
  of the Arts, who was playing with the Suzhou Chinese Orchestra as of 2017. You
  can read more about her and the 13 other musicians featured on this album on
  the publisher’s site, Navona Records. A free copy of this album was sent to
  GZA with the explicit request we share it with the community, so here it is!
