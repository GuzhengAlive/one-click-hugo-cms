  This is the album that got me into modern guzheng compositions. It remains one
  of my favorites. Produced by two incredible musicians with extensive Hollywood
  credits to their name (spoiler: you’ve heard their music) Year of the Funky is
  the joyous result of one of the most skilled and accomplished guzheng players
  in the United States, Bei Bei, combining her expertise with the prodigious
  multi-instrumentalist that is Shawn Lee. I can’t possibly do ether musician
  justice so please check out their personal websites.




  High-Energy with catchy beats, my two favorite tracks are Love in Hong Kong
  and of course, Year of The Funky.




  This 2017 album was produced in association with Légère Recordings.




  Genre: Fusion and Funk




  Instruments: Guzheng, drums, bass, electric guitar…
